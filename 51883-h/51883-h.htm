<p class="drop-cap00"><i>THIS book is the third and last of a
trilogy of romances. In that trilogy
I have endeavoured to show forth the
character of the Virginians&mdash;men and women.</i></p>

<p><i>In “Dorothy South” I tried to show what
the Virginians were while the old life lasted&mdash;“before
the war.”</i></p>

<p><i>In “The Master of Warlock” I endeavoured
faithfully to depict the same people as they were
during the first half of the Civil War, when
their valour seemed to promise everything of
results that they desired. In “Evelyn Byrd” I
have sought to show the heroism of endurance
that marked the conduct of those people during
the last half of the war, when disaster stared
them in the face and they unfalteringly confronted
it.</i></p>

<p class="pch">A STRICKEN CORSAGE</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">A BATTERY of six twelve-pounder Napoleon
guns lay in a little skirt of
woodland on the south bank of the
Rapidan. It was raining, not violently, but with
a soaking persistence that might well have made
the artillery-men tired of life and ready to welcome
whatever end that day’s skirmishing might
bring to the weariness of living. But these men
were veteran soldiers, inured to hardship as well
as to danger. A saturating rain meant next to
nothing to them. A day’s discomfort, more or
less, counted not at all in the monotonously
uncomfortable routine of their lives.</p>

<p>They had been sent into the woodland an
hour or two ago, and had done a little desultory
firing now and then, merely by way of disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the movements of small bodies of the enemy
who were being shifted about on the other side
of the river.</p>

<p>Just now the guns were silent, no enemy
being in sight, and Captain Marshall Pollard
being disposed to save his ammunition against
the time, now obviously near at hand, when the
new commander of the Federal forces, General
Grant, should push the Army of the Potomac
across the river to make a final trial of strength
and sagacity with that small but wonderfully
fighting Army of Northern Virginia directed by
the master mind of Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>But, while no enemy was within sight, there
was a hornets’ nest of Federal sharp-shooters
concealed in a barn not far beyond the river,
and from their secure cover they were very
seriously annoying the Confederate lines. The
barn lay a little to the left of the battery front,
but near enough for the sharp-shooters’ bullets
to cut twigs from the tree under which Captain
Marshall Pollard sat on horseback with Owen
Kilgariff by his side. Still, the fire of the
sharp-shooters was not mainly directed upon
the woodland-screened battery, but upon the
troops in the open field on Pollard’s left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Captain Pollard, with the peculiar
deliberation which characterised all his actions,
lowered his field-glass from his eyes, and, withdrawing
a handkerchief from a rain-proof breast
pocket, began polishing the mist-obscured lenses.
As he did so, he said to Kilgariff:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Order one of the guns to burn that barn.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, both his own horse and Kilgariff’s
sank to the ground; the one struggling
in the agony of a mortal wound, the other
instantly dead.</p>

<p>“And tell the quartermaster-sergeant to send
us two more horses&mdash;good ones,” Captain Pollard
added, with no more of change in his tone
than if the killing of the horses at that precise
moment had been a previously ordered part of
the programme.</p>

<p>A gun was quickly moved up to a little open
space. It fired two shots. The flames burst
from the barn, and instantly a horde of sharp-shooters
abandoned the place and went scurrying
across an open field in search of cover. As
they fled, the gun that had destroyed their
lurking-place, and another which Captain Pollard
had instantly ordered up, shelled them
mercilessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that Owen Kilgariff said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That barn was full of fodder. Its owner
had saved a little something against a future
need, and now all the results of his toil have
gone up in smoke. That’s war!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Captain Pollard, “and the
worst of it is that the man whose possessions
we have destroyed is our friend, and not our
enemy; again, as you say, ‘that’s war.’ War
is destruction&mdash;whether the thing destroyed
be that of friend or foe.”</p>

<p>Just then a new and vicious fire of skilled
sharp-shooters broke forth from the mansion-house
of the plantation to which the burned
barn had belonged. It was an old-time colonial
edifice. Marshall Pollard had spent many
delightful days and nights under its hospitable
roof. He had learned to love its historic associations.
He knew and loved every old portrait
that hung on its oak-wainscotted walls. He
knew and loved every stick of its old, colonial,
plantation-made furniture; its very floors of
white ash, that had been polished every morning
for two hundred years; and its mahogany
dining-table, around which distinguished guests
had gathered through many generations. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
these were dear to the peculiarly sympathetic
soul of the scholar-soldier, Marshall Pollard, a
man born for books, and set by adverse fate to
command batteries instead; a man of creative
genius, as his novels and poems, written after
the war, abundantly proved, set for the time to
do the brutal work of destruction. He remembered
the library of that mansion, too, the slow
accumulation of two hundred years. He had
read there precious volumes that existed nowhere
else in America, and that money could not duplicate,
however lavishly it might be offered for
books, of which no fellows were to be found
except upon the sealed shelves of the British
Museum, or in other great public collections
from which no treasures are ever to be sold
while the world shall endure.</p>

<p>That house, with all its memories and all its
treasures, must be destroyed. Marshall Pollard
clearly understood the necessity, and he was
altogether a soldier now, in spite of his strong
inclinations to peace and civilisation, and all
gentleness of spirit. Yet he found it difficult to
order the work of destruction that it was his
manifest duty to do. Presently, with bullets
whistling about his ears, he turned to Owen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Kilgariff, and, in a tone of petulance that was
wholly foreign to his habit, asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why don’t you order the thing done? Why
do you sit there on your horse waiting for me
to give the order?”</p>

<p>Kilgariff understood. He was a man accustomed
to understand quickly; and now that
Captain Pollard had made him his chief staff
officer, sergeant-major of the battery, his orders,
whatever they might be, carried with them all
the authority of the captain’s own commands.</p>

<p>Kilgariff instantly rode back to the battery
and ordered up two sections&mdash;four guns. Advancing
them well to the front, where the house
to be shot at could be easily seen, he posted
them with entire calm, in spite of the fact that
a Federal battery of rifled guns stationed at a
long distance was playing vigorously upon his
position, and not without effect. The artillery-men
in both armies had, by this late period of
the war, become marksmen so expert that the
only limit of the effectiveness of their fire was
the limit of their range.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of Marshall Pollard’s men bit
the dust, and nearly a dozen of his horses were
killed, while Owen Kilgariff was getting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
four guns into position for the effective doing
of the work to be done, although that process
of placing the guns occupied less than a
minute of time. Two wheels of cannon carriages
were smashed by well-directed rifle
shells, but these were quickly replaced by the
extra wheels carried on the caissons; for every
detail of artillery drill was an <i>a-b-c</i> to the veterans
of this battery, and if the men had nerves,
the fact was never permitted to manifest itself
when there was work of war to be done.</p>

<p>Within sixty seconds after Owen Kilgariff
rode away to give the orders that Marshall
Pollard hesitated to give, four Napoleon guns
were firing four shells each, a minute, into a
mansion that had been famous throughout all
the history of Virginia, since the time when
William Byrd had been Virginia’s foremost
citizen and the Knights of the Golden Horseshoe
had ridden out to possess themselves of
the regions to the west.</p>

<p>Half a minute accomplished the purpose.
The mansion was in flames, the sharp-shooters
who had made a fortress of it were scurrying
to the cover of the underbrush a few hundred
yards in rear, and Owen Kilgariff ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
guns to “cease firing” and return to the cover
of the woodlands whence they had been
brought forward for this service. Six of
Marshall Pollard’s men lay stark and stiff on
the little meadow which the guns had occupied.
These were hastily removed for decent burial.
Nine others were wounded. They were carried
away upon litters for surgical attention.</p>

<p>These details in no way disturbed the battery
camp. They were the commonplaces of war;
so the men, unmindful of them, cooked such
dinner as they could command, and ate it with a
relish unimpaired by the events of the morning.</p>

<p>But Captain Marshall Pollard and his companion,
Sergeant-major Owen Kilgariff, were
not minded for dinner. Seeing the flames burst
forth from the upper stories of the old colonial
mansion, Kilgariff said to his captain:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I wonder if all those fellows got away?
There may be a wounded man or two left in
the house to roast to death. May I ride over
there and see?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Pollard, “and I will ride
with you. But first order two of the guns to
shell the sharp-shooters in the thicket yonder.
Otherwise we may not get back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the heavy fire that the two guns
poured into the thicket beyond the house, the
sharp-shooters stood their ground like the veterans
that they were, and Pollard and Kilgariff
were their targets as these two swam the
swollen river and galloped across the last year’s
corn lands on their way to the burning house.</p>

<p>Arrived there, they hastily searched the
upper rooms. Here and there they came upon
a dead soldier, left by his companions to be incinerated
in company with the portraits of old
colonial notables and beautiful colonial dames
that were falling from the walls as the ancient
oaken wainscot shrivelled in the fire.</p>

<p>But no living thing was found there, and the
two Confederates, satisfied now that there was
no life to be saved, hurried down the burning
stairway and out into the air, where instantly
they became targets again for the sharp-shooters,
not three hundred yards away.</p>

<p>As they were about to mount their horses,
which had been screened behind a wall projection,
Kilgariff suddenly bethought him of the
cellar, and plunged down the stairway leading
to it. He was promptly followed by his captain,
though both of them realised the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
danger of the descent at a time when the whole
structure seemed about to tumble into that pit
as a mass of burning timber. But they realised
also that the cellar was the place where they
were most likely to find living men too badly
wounded to make their escape, and so, in spite
of the terrible hazard, they plunged into the
depths, intent only upon their errand of mercy.</p>

<p>A hasty glance around in the half-light
seemed to reveal only the emptiness of the
cavernous cellar. But just as the two companions
were about to quit the place, in a
hurried effort to save themselves, a great,
blazing beam fell in, together with a massive
area of flame-enveloped flooring, illuminating
the place. As Kilgariff turned, he caught
sight of a girl, crouching behind an angle of
the wall. She was a tall, slender creature,
and Kilgariff was mighty in his muscularity.
There was not a fraction of a second to be
lost if escape from that fire pit was in any
wise to be accomplished. Without a moment’s
pause, Kilgariff threw his arm around the girl
and bore her up the cellar stairs, just as the
whole burning mass of timbers sank suddenly
into the space below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>His captain followed him closely; and, emerging
from the flames, scorched and smoke-stifled,
the three stood still for a moment, under the
deadly fire of the sharp-shooters. Then, with
recovered breath, they turned an angle of the
wall, mounted their horses, and sped away
toward the river, under a rifle fire that seemed
sufficient for the destruction of a regiment.
The shells from their own side of the line,
shrieking above the heads of the three fugitives,
made their horses squat almost to the ground;
but with a resolution born of long familiarity
with danger, the two soldiers sped on, Kilgariff
carrying the girl on the withers of his horse
and trying to shield her from the fire of the
sharp-shooters by so riding as to interpose his
own body between her and the swiftly on-coming
bullets.</p>

<p>Finally the river was reached, and, plunging
into it, the two horses bore their burdens safely
across. Pollard might easily have been fifty
yards in advance of his sergeant-major, seeing
that he had the better horse, and that his companion’s
animal was carrying double. But that
was not Marshall Pollard’s way. Instead of
riding as fast as he could toward the river and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the comparative safety that lay beyond it, he
rode with his horse’s head just overlapping the
flanks of the animal which bore the girl and her
rescuer. In this way he managed to make of
himself and his horse a protecting barrier between
the enemy and the girl whom Kilgariff
was so gallantly trying to bear to safety.</p>

<p>This was not a battle, or anything remotely
resembling a battle. If it had been, these two
men would not have left their posts in the
battery. It was only an insignificant “operation
of outposts,” which the commanders in the
front of both armies that night reported as
“some slight skirmishing along the outer lines.”
On neither side was it thought worth while to
add that fifty or sixty brave young fellows had
been done to death in the “slight skirmishing.”
The war was growing old in the spring of
1864. Officers, hardened by experience of human
butchery on a larger scale, no longer
thought it necessary to report death losses that
did not require three figures for their recording.</p>

<p>When Pollard and Kilgariff reached the bit
of woodland in which the battery had been
posted for a special purpose, they found the
guns already gone. The battery had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ordered during their absence to return to its
more permanent camp two or three miles in
the rear, and in Captain Pollard’s absence his
senior lieutenant had taken command to execute
the order. It is the way of war that “men
may come and men may go,” but there is
always some one next in command to take the
place of one in authority who meets death or
is absent for any other cause. An army organisation
resembles Nature herself in its scrupulous
care for the general result, and in its
absolute indifference to the welfare or the fate
of the individual.</p>

<p>War is a merciless thing&mdash;inhuman, demoniacal,
devilish. But incidentally it calls into
activity many of the noblest qualities of human
nature. It had done so in this instance. Having
fired the house on the enemy’s side of the
river, and having thus driven away a company
of sharp-shooters who were grievously annoying
the Confederate line, Captain Pollard’s duty
was fully done. But, at the suggestion that
some wounded enemy might have been left in
the house to perish in the torture of the flames,
he and his companion had deliberately crossed
the river into the enemy’s country, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ridden under a galling fire to the burning building,
as earnestly and as daringly intent upon
their mission of mercy as they had been a little
while before upon their work of slaughter and
destruction.</p>

<p>“Man’s a strange animal,” sings the poet,
and his song is an echo of truth.</p>

<p>Pollard and Kilgariff rode on until the camp
was reached. There Kilgariff pushed his horse
at once to the tent of the surgeon, and delivered
the girl into that officer’s keeping.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he said. “I fear she is terribly
wounded.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the girl; “I am not hurt.
It is only that my corsage is&mdash;what you call
stricken. Is it that that is the word? No?
Then what shall I say? It is only that the
bullet hurt what you call my stays. Truly it
did not touch me.”</p>

<p>Just then Captain Pollard observed that Kilgariff’s
left hand was wrapped in a piece torn
from the front of the girl’s gown, and that the
rude bandage was saturated with blood. Contrary
to all military rule, the sergeant-major had
been holding his reins in his right hand, and
carrying the girl in the support of his left arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
This awkwardness, as he was at pains to explain
to the captain, had been brought about by the
hurry of necessity.</p>

<p>“I grabbed the girl,” he explained, “without
a thought of anything but the danger to her.
The house timbers were already falling, and
there was no time to be lost. When I got to
my horse, the fire of the sharp-shooters was too
severe to be trifled with when I had a girl to
protect, so I mounted from the right side of
my horse instead of the left, and continued to
ride with her on my left arm and my bridle-rein
in my right hand. I make my apologies,
Captain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound your apologies!” ejaculated
Captain Pollard. “What’s the matter with
your left hand? Let the surgeon see it at
once.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing of consequence,” answered the
young man, stripping off the rudely improvised
bandage. “Only the ends of a finger or two
carried away. I had thought until a moment
ago that the bullet had penetrated the young
lady’s body. You see, Captain, I was holding
her in front of me and clasping her closely
around the waist with my fingers extended, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
better to hold her in her uncertain seat on the
withers. So, when the bullet struck my fingers,
I thought it had pierced her person. Thank
God, she has come off safe! But by the time
the surgeon is through with his work on my fingers,
I shall have to use my right hand on the
bridle for a considerable time to come, Captain.”</p>

<p>“You will have to go to the hospital,” said
the surgeon.</p>

<p>“Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Kilgariff?” asked Pollard, who
had become mightily interested in the strange
and strangely reserved young man whom he had
made his sergeant-major.</p>

<p>“Why not? Why, because I’m not going to
miss the greatest and probably the last campaign
of the greatest war of all time.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the captain turned away toward
his tent, leaving Kilgariff to endure the painful
operations of the surgeon upon his wounded
hand, without chloroform, for there was none of
that anæsthetic left among the supplies of this
meagrely furnished field-hospital after the work
already done upon the wounded men of that
morning. Kilgariff endured the amputations
without a groan or so much as a flinching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
whereat the surgeon marvelled the more, seeing
that the patient was a man of exceptionally nervous
constitution and temperament. When the
bandages were all in place, the sergeant-major
said simply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Please let me have a stiff drink of spirits,
Doctor. I am a trifle inclined to faintness after
the pain.” That was absolutely the only sign
the man gave of the fact that he had been
enduring torture for nearly a half-hour.</p>

<p>Relighting his pipe, which he had smoked
throughout the painful operation, Kilgariff bade
the doctor good morning, and walked away to
the tent which he and the captain together
occupied.</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain Pollard had been
questioning the girl as to herself, and getting
no satisfactory answers from her, not so much
because of any unwillingness on her part to give
an account of herself, as seemingly because she
either did not understand the questions put to
her, or did not know what the answers to them
ought to be.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Captain,” said Kilgariff,
when Pollard had briefly suggested the situation
to him, “Doctor Brent is at Orange Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
House, I hear, reorganising the field-hospital
service for the coming campaign, and his wife
is with him. Why not send the girl to her?”</p>

<p>“To Dorothy? Yes, I’ll send her to Dorothy.
She will know what to do.”</p>

<p>He hastily summoned an ambulance for the
girl to ride in, and still more hastily scribbled a
note to Dorothy Brent&mdash;to her who had been
Dorothy South in the days of her maidenhood
before the war. In it he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I am sending you, under escort, a girl whom my
sergeant-major most daringly rescued this morning
from a house on the enemy’s side of the river, after
we had shelled and set fire to the place. She seems
too badly scared, or too something else, for me to find
out anything about her. You, with your womanly
tact, will perhaps be able to gain her confidence and
find out what should be done. If she has friends at
the North to whom she should be returned, I will
arrange with General Stuart to send her back across
the river under a flag of truce. If she hasn’t any
friends, or if for any other reason she should be kept
within our lines, you will know what to do with her.
I am helpless in such a case, and I earnestly invoke
the aid of the very wisest woman I ever knew.
When you see the girl&mdash;poor, innocent child that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
she is&mdash;you, who were once yourself a child, and
who, in growing older, have lost none of the sweetness
and especially none of the moral courage of
childhood, will be interested, I am very sure, in taking
charge of her for her good.</p>

<p class="p1">Having despatched this note, and the girl,
under escort, Pollard turned to Kilgariff, and
abruptly asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why did you call this coming campaign
‘the greatest and probably the last campaign’
of the war?”</p>

<p>“Why, all that seems obvious. The Army of
the Potomac has at last found a commander
who knows how to handle it, and both sides are
tired of the war. Grant is altogether a different
man from McClellan, or Pope, or McDowell, or
Burnside, or Meade. He knows his business.
He knows that the chief remaining strength of
the Confederacy lies in the fighting force of the
Army of Northern Virginia. He will strike
straight at that. He will hurl his whole force
upon us in an effort to destroy this army.
If he succeeds, the Confederacy can’t last even
a fortnight after that. If he fails, if Lee hurls
him back across the Rapidan, broken and
beaten as all his predecessors have been, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
North will never raise another army&mdash;if the
feeling there is anything like what the Northern
newspapers represent it to be. You see, I’ve
been reading them all the while&mdash;but, pardon
me, I meant only to answer your question.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apologise,” answered Pollard. And
he wondered who this man, his sergeant-major,
was&mdash;whence he had come, and how, and why.
For Captain Marshall Pollard knew absolutely
nothing about the man whom he had made his
confidential staff-sergeant, his tent mate, his
bedfellow, and the executant of all his orders.
Nevertheless, he trusted him implicitly. “I do
not know his history,” he reflected, “but I know
his quality as a man and a soldier.”</p>

<h2 class="ch">II</h2>

<p class="pch">OWEN KILGARIFF</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE relations between Pollard and Kilgariff
were peculiar. In many ways
they were inexplicable except upon the
ground of instinctive sympathy between two
men, each of whom recognised the other as a
gentleman; both of whom were possessed of
scholarly tastes combined with physical vigour
and all that is possible of manliness; both of
whom loved books and knew them intimately;
and each of whom recognised in the other somewhat
more than is common of intellectual force.</p>

<p>The history of their acquaintance had been
quite unusual. Marshall Pollard had risen from
the ranks to be now the captain of a battery
originally organised and commanded by Captain
Skinner, a West Point graduate who had resigned
from the United States army many years
before the war, but not until after he had seen
much service in Mexico and in Indian warfare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The battery had been composed at the outset
of ruffians from the purlieus of Richmond, jailbirds,
wharf-rats, beach-combers, men pardoned
out of the penitentiary on condition of their enlistment,
and the friends and associates of such
men. It had been a fiercely fighting battery
from the beginning. Slowly but surely many of
the men who had originally constituted it had
been killed in battle, and Virginia mountaineers
had been enlisted to fill their places. In the
meanwhile discipline of the rigidest military sort
had wrought a wonderful change for the better
in such of the men as survived from the original
organisation. By the time that the battery returned
to Virginia, after covering itself with
glory at Gettysburg, it was no longer a company
of ruffians and criminals, but it continued to
maintain its reputation for desperate fighting
and for cool, self-contained, and unfaltering
courage. For those mountaineers of Virginia
were desperately loyal to the fighting traditions
of their race.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1863-4 Captain Pollard’s
battery was stationed at Lindsay’s Turnout, on
the Virginia Central Railroad a few miles west
of Gordonsville. Indescribable, almost inconceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
mud was the characteristic of that
winter, and General Lee had taken advantage
of it, and of the complete veto it placed upon
even the smallest military operations, to retire
the greater part of his army from the Rappahannock
and the Rapidan to the railroads in the
rear, where it was possible to feed the men and
the horses, at least in some meagre fashion.</p>

<p>It was during this stay in winter quarters that
Owen Kilgariff had come to the battery.
Whence he came, or how he got there, nobody
knew and nobody could guess. There were only
two trains a day on the railroad; one going east,
and the other going west. It was the duty of
strong guards from Pollard’s battery to man the
station whenever a train arrived and inspect the
passports of every passenger who descended from
the cars to the platform or passed from the platform
to the cars. Owen Kilgariff had not come
by any of the trains. That much was absolutely
certain, and nobody knew any other way by which
he could have come. Yet one evening he appeared
in Pollard’s battery at retreat roll-call and
stood looking on and listening while the orders
for the night were being read to the men.</p>

<p>He was a singularly comely young man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
thirty years, or a little less&mdash;tall, rather slender,
though very muscular, symmetrical in an
unusual degree, and carrying his large and
well-shaped head with the ease and grace of a
trained athlete.</p>

<p>When the military function was ended and
the men had broken ranks, Kilgariff approached
Captain Pollard, and with a faultlessly correct
military salute said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captain, I crave your permission to pass
the night with some of your men. In the
morning I think I shall ask you to enlist me in
your battery.”</p>

<p>There was something in the man’s speech
and manner which strongly appealed to Marshall
Pollard’s sympathy and awakened his
respect.</p>

<p>“You shall be my own personal guest for the
night,” he said; “I can offer you some bacon
and corn bread for supper, and a bundle of dry
broom-straw grass to sleep upon. As for enlistment,
we’ll talk further about that in the
morning.”</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly. The stranger
was obviously a gentleman to his finger tips.
He conversed with rare intelligence and interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
upon every subject that happened to arise
among the officers who were accustomed to
gather in the captain’s hut every evening, making
a sort of club of his headquarters. Incidentally
some one made reference during the
evening to some reported Japanese custom.
Instantly but very modestly Kilgariff said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but that is one of many misapprehensions
concerning the Japanese. They
have no such custom. The notion arose originally
out of a misunderstanding&mdash;a misinterpretation;
it got into print, and has been
popularly accepted ever since. Let me tell
you, if you care to listen, what the facts really
are.”</p>

<p>Then he went on, by eager invitation, to talk
long and interestingly about Japan and the
Japanese&mdash;matters then very slightly known&mdash;speaking
all the while with the modest confidence
of one who knows his subject, but who
is in no sense disposed to display the extent of
his knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, inquiry brought out the modestly reluctant
information that Kilgariff had been a
member&mdash;though he avoided saying in what
capacity&mdash;of Commodore Perry’s expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which compelled the opening of the Japanese
ports, and that instead of returning with the
expedition, he had somehow quitted it and
made his way into the interior of the hermit
empire, where he had passed a year or two in
minute exploration.</p>

<p>All this was drawn out by questioning only,
and in no case did Kilgariff go beyond the question
asked, to volunteer information. Especially
he avoided speaking of himself or of his achievements
at any point in his conversation. He
would say, “An American” did this, “An English-speaking
man” saw that, “A foreigner had
an experience,” and so forth. The first personal
pronoun singular was almost completely absent
from his conversation.</p>

<p>One of the lieutenants was a Frenchman, and
to him Kilgariff spoke in French whenever that
officer seemed at a loss to understand a statement
made in English. The surgeon was a
German, and with him Kilgariff talked in German
about scientific matters, and in such fashion
that the doctor said to Pollard next morning:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is that this man an accomplished physician
is, or I mightily mistaken am already.”</p>

<p>In the morning Owen Kilgariff warmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
thanked Captain Pollard for his entertainment,
adding:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As one gentleman with another, you have
been free to offer, and I free to accept, your
hospitality. Be very sure that I shall not presume
upon this after I become a common soldier
under your command, as I intend to do this
morning if I have your permission.”</p>

<p>Pollard protested that his battery was not a
proper one for a man of Kilgariff’s culture and
refinement to enlist in, explaining that such of
the men as were not ex-criminals were illiterate
mountaineers, wholly unfit for association on
equal terms with him. For answer, Kilgariff
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am told that you yourself enlisted here,
Captain, when the conditions were even less
alluring than now.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, certainly. But my case was
peculiar.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps mine is equally so,” answered the
man. “At any rate, I very much want to
enlist under your command, in a battery that,
as I learn, usually manages to get into the
thick of every fight and to stay there to the
end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A question was on Pollard’s lips, which he
greatly wanted to ask, but he dared not. With
the instinctive shrinking of a gentleman from
the impertinence of personal questioning, Pollard
found it impossible to ask this man how it happened
that he was not already a soldier somewhere.
And yet the matter was one which very
naturally prompted questioning. The Confederate
conscription laws had long ago brought into
the army every able-bodied man in the South.
How happened it, then, that this man of twenty-eight
or thirty years of age, perfect in physique,
had managed to avoid service until this fourth
year of the war? And how was it, that one so
manifestly eager now for service of the most
active kind had been willing to keep out of the
army for so long a time?</p>

<p>As if divining the thought which Captain
Pollard could not bring himself to formulate,
Kilgariff said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Some day, perhaps, I shall be able to tell
you how and why it is that I am not already
a soldier. At present I cannot. But I assure
you, on my honour as a gentleman, that there
is absolutely no obstacle in the way of your
enlistment of me in your command. I earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ask you to accept me as one of your cannoniers.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the man was enrolled as a private
in the battery, and from that hour he never
once presumed upon the acquaintance he had
been privileged to form with the officers. With
a scrupulosity greater than was common even
in that rigidly disciplined command, he observed
the distinction between officers and
enlisted men. His behaviour indeed was that
of one bred under the strict surveillance of
martinet professors in a military school. He
did all his military duties of whatever kind with
a like attention to every detail of good conduct;
always obeying like a soldier, never like a servant.
That distinction is broad and very important
as an index of character.</p>

<p>The officers liked him, and Pollard especially
sought him out for purposes of conversation.
The men liked him, too, though they felt instinctively
that he was their superior. Perhaps
their liking for him was in large part due to the
fact that he never asserted or in any wise assumed
his superiority&mdash;never recognised it, in
fact, even by implication.</p>

<p>He nearly always had a book somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
about his person&mdash;a book borrowed in most
cases, but bought when there was no opportunity
to borrow, for the man seemed always to
have money in plenty. Now and then he would
go to a quartermaster or a paymaster with a gold
piece and exchange it for a great roll of the
nearly worthless Confederate notes. These he
would spend for books or whatever else he
wanted.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when the men of the battery
had been left for thirteen bitterly cold days and
nights with no food except a meagre dole of
corn meal, Kilgariff bought a farmer’s yoke of
oxen that had become stalled in the muddy
roadway near the camp. These were emphatically
“lean kine,” and their flesh would make
very tough beef, but the toughest beef imaginable
was better than no meat at all, and so
Kilgariff paid what looked like a king’s ransom
for the half-starved and wholly “stalled” oxen,
got two of the men who had had experience in
such work to slaughter and dress them, and
asked the commissary-sergeant to distribute the
meat among the men.</p>

<p>The next day he exchanged another gold
piece for Confederate notes enough to paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a goodly sized wall, and the men rightly guessed
that for some reason, known only to himself, this
stranger among them carried a supply of gold
coin in a belt buckled about his waist. But not
one of them ever ventured to ask him concerning
the matter. He was clearly not a man to
be questioned with regard to his personal affairs.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Captain Pollard, who
had made this man successively corporal, sergeant,
and finally sergeant-major, solely on
grounds of obvious fitness, actually knew nothing
about him, except that he was an ideally
good soldier and a man of education and
culture.</p>

<p>Now that he had become sergeant-major, his
association with the captain was close and constant.
The two occupied the same tent or hut&mdash;when
they had a tent or hut&mdash;messed together,
slept together, and rode side by side
whithersoever the captain had occasion to go
on duty. They read together, too, in their idle
hours, and talked much with each other about
books, men, and affairs. But never once did
Captain Pollard ask a personal question of his
executive sergeant and intimate personal associate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor did Kilgariff ever volunteer the smallest
hint of information concerning himself, either
to the captain or to anybody else. On the contrary,
he seemed peculiarly to shrink even from
the accidental or incidental revelation of anything
pertaining to himself.</p>

<p>One day, in winter quarters, a gunner was
trying to open a shell which had failed to explode
when fired from the enemy’s battery into
the Confederate lines. The missile burst while
the gunner was handling it, and tore off the
poor fellow’s hand. The surgeon had ridden
away somewhither&mdash;nobody knew whither&mdash;and
it was at least a mile’s distance to the nearest
camp where a surgeon might be found.
Meanwhile, the man seemed doomed to bleed
to death. The captain was hurriedly wondering
what to do, when Kilgariff came quietly but
quickly, pushed his way through the group of
excited men, knotted a handkerchief, and deftly
bound it around the wounded man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Hold that firmly,” he said to a corporal
standing by. “Watch the stump, and if the
blood begins to flow again, twist the loop a
trifle tighter, but not too tight, only enough to
prevent a free hemorrhage&mdash;bleeding, I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, touching his cap brim, he asked the
captain:&mdash;</p>

<p>“May I go to the surgeon’s tent and bring
some necessary appliances? I think I may save
this poor fellow’s life, and there is no time to be
lost.”</p>

<p>The captain gave permission, of course, and
a few minutes later Kilgariff returned with a
score of things needed. Kneeling, he arranged
them on the ground. Then he examined
the wounded man’s pulse, and with a look
of satisfaction saturated a handkerchief with
chloroform from a bottle he had brought.
He then turned again to Captain Pollard,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Will you kindly hold that over the man’s
nose and mouth? And will you put your finger
on his uninjured wrist, observing the pulse-beats
carefully? Tell me, please, if any marked
change occurs.”</p>

<p>“Why, what are you going to do?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>“With your permission, I am going to amputate
this badly shattered wrist. There is no
time to be lost.”</p>

<p>With that, he set to work, pausing only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
direct one of the corporals to keep the men
back and prevent too close a crowding around
the patient.</p>

<p>With what seemed to Captain Pollard incredible
quickness, Kilgariff amputated the arm
above the wrist, took up the arteries, and
neatly bandaged the wound. Then he bade
some of the men bear the patient on a litter to
his hut, and place him in his bunk. He remained
by the poor fellow’s side until the
effects of shock and chloroform had subsided.
Then he returned to his quarters quite as if
nothing out of the ordinary routine had happened.</p>

<p>Captain Pollard had seen enough of field
surgery during his three years of active military
service to know that Kilgariff’s work in this
case had been done with the skill of an expert,
and his astonishment over this revelation of
his sergeant-major’s accomplishment was great.
Nevertheless, he shrank from questioning the
man about the matter, or saying anything to
him which might be construed as an implied
question. All that he said was:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I thank you, Kilgariff, and congratulate
you! You have saved a good man’s life this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
day, and God does not give it to many men to
do that.”</p>

<p>“I hope the surgeon will find my work satisfactory,”
responded the sergeant-major. “Is
there any soup in the kettle, Tom?”&mdash;addressing
the coloured cook. “Bring me a cup of it,
please.”</p>

<p>The man’s nerves had gone through a fearful
strain, of course, as every surgeon’s do when he
performs a capital operation, and the captain
saw that Kilgariff was exhausted. He offered
to send for a drink of whiskey, but Kilgariff
declined it, saying that the hot soup was quite
all he needed. The bugle blowing the retreat
call a moment later, Kilgariff went, quite as if
nothing had happened, to call the roll and
deliver the orders for the night.</p>

<p>A little later the surgeon returned and was
told what had happened. After looking at the
bandages, and without removing them, he muttered
something in German and walked away
to the captain’s quarters. He was surgeon to
this battery only, for the reason that the company
was for the time detached from its battalion,
and must have a medical officer of its
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Entering the captain’s quarters, the bluff but
emotional German doctor grasped Kilgariff’s
hand, and broke forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is that you are a brother then as well as
a frient already. Why then haf you not to me
that you are a surgeon told it? Ach! I haf
myself that you speak the German forgot. It
is only in the German that I can what I wish to
tell you say.”</p>

<p>Then in German the excited doctor went on
to lavish praise upon the younger man for his
skill. Presently the captain, seeing how sorely
Kilgariff was embarrassed by the encomiums,
came to his relief by asking:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have you taken off the bandages, Doctor,
and examined the wound?”</p>

<p>“Shade of Esculapius, NO! What am I,
that I should with such a bandaging tamper?
One glance&mdash;one, what you call, look&mdash;quite
enough tells me. This the work of a master is&mdash;it
is not the work with which for me to interfere.
The man who those bandages put on,
that man knows what the best masters can
teach. It is not under the bandages that I
need to look to find out that. Ach, Herr Sergeant-major,
I to you my homage offer. Five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
years I in the hospitals of Berlin am, and
four years in Vienna. In the army of Austria
I am surgeon for six years. Do I not
know?”</p>

<p>Then the doctor began to question Kilgariff
in German, to the younger man’s sore embarrassment.
But, fortunately for his reserve, Kilgariff
had the German language sufficiently at
his command to parry every question, and when
tattoo sounded, the excited surgeon returned to
his own quarters, still muttering his astonishment
and admiration.</p>

<p>In the morning Captain Pollard asked Kilgariff
to ride with him, in order that they two
might the better talk together. But even on
horseback Pollard found it difficult to approach
this man upon any subject that seemed in the
least degree personal. It was not that there
was anything repellent, anything combative,
and still less anything pugnacious in Kilgariff’s
manner; for there was never anything of the
sort. It was only that the man was so full of
a gentle dignity, so saturated with that reserve
which a gentleman instinctively feels concerning
his own affairs that no other gentleman
wishes to intrude upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, Pollard had something to say to his sergeant-major
on this occasion, and presently he
said it:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I did not know until yesterday,” he began,
“that you were a surgeon, Kilgariff.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should not call myself that,” interrupted
the man, as if anxious to forestall the
captain’s thought. “One who has knocked
about the world as much as I have naturally
picks up a good many bits of useful information&mdash;especially
with regard to the emergency care
of men who get themselves hurt.”</p>

<p>“Now listen to me, Kilgariff,” said Pollard,
with determination. “Don’t try to hoodwink
me. I have never asked you a question about
your personal affairs, and I don’t intend to do so
now. You need not seek by indirection to mislead
me. I shall not ask you whether you are a
surgeon or not. There is no need. I have seen
too much with my own eyes, and I have heard
too much from our battery surgeon as to your
skill, to believe for one moment that it is of
the ‘jack-at-all-trades’ kind. But I ask you no
questions. I respect your privacy, as I demand
respect for my own. But I want to say to you
that this army is badly in need of surgeons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
especially surgeons whose skill is greater than
that of the half-educated country doctors, many
of whom we have been obliged to commission
for want of better-equipped men. I learn this
from my friend Doctor Arthur Brent, who tells
me he is constantly embarrassed by his inability
to find really capable and experienced surgeons
to do the more difficult work of the general hospitals.
He said to me only a week ago, when
he came to the front to reorganise the medical
service for this year’s campaign, that ‘many
hundreds of gallant men will die this summer
for lack of a sufficient number of highly skilled
surgeons.’ He explained that while we have
many men in the service whose skill is of the
highest, we have not nearly enough of such to
fill the places in which they are needed. Now
I want you to let me send you to Doctor Brent
with a letter of introduction. He will quickly
procure a commission for you as a major-surgeon.
It isn’t fit that such a man as you
should waste himself in the position of a non-commissioned
officer.”</p>

<p>Not until he had finished the speech did Pollard
turn his eyes upon his companion’s face.
Then he saw it to be pale&mdash;almost cadaverous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Obviously the man was undergoing an agonising
struggle with himself.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Kilgariff,” hastily spoke
Captain Pollard, “if I have said anything to
wound you; I could not know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not that,” responded the sergeant-major.
But he added nothing to the declaration
for a full minute afterward, during which
time he was manifestly struggling to control
himself. Finally recovering his calm, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you, Captain, and I thank
you for it. But I cannot accept your offer of
service. I must remain as I am. I ought to
have remained a private, as I at first intended.
It is very ungracious in me not to tell you the
wherefore of this, but I cannot, and your already
demonstrated respect for my privacy will
surely forbid you to resent a reserve concerning
myself which I am bound to maintain. If you
do resent it, or if it displeases you in the least,
I beg you to accept my resignation as your
sergeant-major, and let me return to my place
among the men as a private in the battery.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Pollard, decisively. “If the
army cannot have the advantage of your service
in any higher capacity, I certainly shall not let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
myself lose your intelligence and devotion as
my staff-sergeant. Believe me, Kilgariff, I
spoke only for your good and the good of the
service.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand, Captain, and I thank
you. But with your permission we will let
matters remain as they are.”</p>

<p>All this occurred about a week before the
events related in the first chapter of this story.</p>

<h2 class="ch">III</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN BYRD</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN the girl whom Kilgariff had
rescued from the burning building
was delivered into Dorothy Brent’s
hands, that most gracious of gentlewomen received
her quite as if her coming had been
expected, and as if there had been nothing
unusual in the circumstances that had led to
her visit. Dorothy was too wise and too considerate
to question the frightened girl about
herself upon her first arrival. She saw that
she was half scared and wholly bewildered by
what had happened to her, added to which her
awe of Dorothy herself, stately dame that the
very young wife of Doctor Brent seemed in her
unaccustomed eyes, was a circumstance to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>“I must teach her to love me first,” thought
Dorothy, with the old straightforwardness of
mind. “Then she will trust me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>So, after she had hastily read Pollard’s note
and characterised it as “just like a man not to
find out the girl’s name,” she took the poor,
frightened, fawnlike creature in her arms, saying,
with caresses that were genuine inspirations
of her nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Poor, dear girl! You have had a very hard
day of it. Now the first thing for you to do is
to rest. So come on up to my room. You shall
have a refreshing little bath&mdash;I’ll give it to you
myself with Mammy’s aid&mdash;and then you shall
go regularly to bed.”</p>

<p>“But,” queried the doubting girl, “is it permitted
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know you are faint with hunger,
and you shall have your breakfast as soon as
Dick can get it ready. Queer, isn’t it, to take
breakfast at three o’clock in the afternoon?
But you shall have it in bed, with nobody to
bother you. Fortunately we have some coffee,
and Dick is an expert in making coffee. I
taught him myself. I don’t know, of course, how
much or how little experience you have had
with servants, but I have always found that
when I want them to do things in my way, I
must take all the trouble necessary to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
them what my way is. Get her shoes and
stockings off quick, Mammy.”</p>

<p>“I have had little to do with servants,” said
the girl, simply, “and so I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you ever have a dear old mammy?
queried Dorothy, thus asking the first of the
questions that must be asked in order to discover
the girl’s identity.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes. I don’t know. You see, they
made me swear to tell nothing. I mustn’t tell
after that, must I?”</p>

<p>“No, you dear girl; no. You needn’t tell
me anything. I was only wondering what girls
do when they haven’t a good old mammy like
mine to coddle them and regulate them and
make them happy. Why, you can’t imagine
what a bad girl I should have been if I hadn’t
had Mammy here to scold me and keep me
straight. Can she, Mammy?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” ejaculated the old coloured nurse.
“Much good my scoldin’ o’ you done do, Mis’
Dorothy. Dere nebber was a chile so cantankerous
as you is always been an’ is to dis day.
I’d be ’shamed to tell dis heah young lady ’bout
your ways an’ your manners. Howsomever,
she kin jedge fer herse’f, seein’ as she fin’s you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
heah ’mong all de soldiers, when you oughter
be at Wyanoke a-givin’ o’ dinin’-days, an’ a-entertainin’
o’ yer frien’s. I’se had a hard time
with you, Mis’ Dorothy, all my life. What fer
you always a-botherin’ ’bout a lot o’ sick people
an’ wounded men, jes’ as yo’ done do ’bout dem
no-’count niggas down at Wyanoke when dey
done gone an’ got deyselves sick? Ah, well,
I spec dat’s what ole mammies is bawn fer&mdash;jes’
to reg’late dere precious chiles when de’re
bent on habin’ dere own way anyhow. Don’
you go fer to listen to Mis’ Dorothy ’bout sich
things, nohow, Mis’&mdash;what’s yer name, honey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can tell,” answered the girl,
frightened again, apparently; “at least, not certainly.
It is Evelyn Byrd, but there was something
else added to it at last, and I don’t want
to tell what the rest of it is.”</p>

<p>“Then you are a Virginian?” said Dorothy,
quickly, surprised into a question when she
meant to ask none.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said the girl; “I’m not quite
sure.”</p>

<p>She looked frightened again, and Dorothy
pursued the inquiry no further, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t bother about that. Evelyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Byrd is name enough for anybody to bear, and
it is thoroughly Virginian. Here comes your
breakfast”&mdash;as Dick knocked at the door with
a tray which Mammy took from his hands and
herself brought to the bed in which the girl had
been placed after her bath. “We won’t bother
about anything now. Just take your breakfast,
and then try to sleep a little. You must be
utterly worn out.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at her wistfully, but said
nothing. She ate sparingly, but apparently
with the relish of one who is faint for want of
food, the which led Dorothy to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was just like a man to send you on here
without giving you something to eat.”</p>

<p>“You are very good to me.” That was all
the girl said in reply.</p>

<p>When she had rested, Dorothy sitting sewing
in the meanwhile, the girl turned to her hostess
and asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Might I put on my clothes again, now?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. Now that you are rested,
you are to do whatever you wish.”</p>

<p>“Am I? I was never allowed to do anything
I wished before this time&mdash;at least not
often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The remark opened the way for questioning,
but Dorothy was too discreet to avail herself of
the opportunity. She said only:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, so long as you stay with me, Evelyn,
you are to do precisely as you please. I believe
in liberty for every one. You heard what
Mammy said about me. Dear old Mammy has
been trying to govern me ever since I was born,
and never succeeding, simply because she never
really wanted to succeed. Don’t you think
people are the better for being left free to do as
they please in all innocent ways?”</p>

<p>There was a fleeting expression as of pained
memory on the girl’s face. She did not answer
immediately, but sat gazing as any little child
might, into Dorothy’s face. After a little, she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know. You see, I know so
very little. I think I would like best to do
whatever you please for me to do. Yes. That
is what I would like best.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go with me to my home,
and live there with me till you find your
friends?”</p>

<p>“I would like that, yes. But I think I haven’t
any friends&mdash;I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Dorothy, “sometime you shall
tell me about that&mdash;some day when you have
come to love me and feel like telling me about
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the girl. “I think I love
you already. But I mustn’t tell anything because
of what they made me swear.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave all that till we get to Wyanoke,”
said Dorothy. “Wyanoke, you should know,
is Doctor Brent’s plantation. It is my home.
You and I will go to Wyanoke within a day or
two. Just as soon as my husband, Doctor
Brent, can spare me.”</p>

<p>The girl was manifestly losing something of
her timidity under the influence of her new-found
trust and confidence in Dorothy, and
Dorothy was quick to discover the fact, but
cautious not to presume upon it. The two
talked till supper time, and the girl accompanied
her hostess to that meal, where, for the first
time, she met Arthur Brent. That adept in the
art of observation so managed the conversation
as to find out a good deal about Evelyn Byrd,
without letting her know or suspect that he was
even interested in her. He asked her no questions
concerning herself or her past, but drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
her into a shy participation in the general conversation.
That night he said to Dorothy:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That girl has brains and a character. Both
have been dwarfed, or rather forbidden development,
whether purposely or by accidental circumstances
I cannot determine. You will find
out when you get her to Wyanoke, and it really
doesn’t matter. Under your influence she will
grow as a plant does in the sunshine. I almost
envy you your pupil.”</p>

<p>“She will be yours, too, even more than
mine.”</p>

<p>“After a while, perhaps, but not for some
time to come. I have much more to do here
than I thought, and shall have to leave the
laboratory work at Wyanoke to you for the
present. You’d better set out to-morrow morning.
The railroads are greatly overtaxed just
now, as General Lee is using every car he can
get for the transportation of troops and supplies&mdash;mainly
troops, for heaven knows there are
not many supplies to be carried. I have promised
the surgeon-general that the laboratory at
Wyanoke shall be worked to its full capacity in
the preparation of medicines and appliances, so
you are needed there at once. But under present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
conditions it is better that you travel across
country in a carriage. I’ve arranged all that.
You will have a small military escort as far as
the James River. After that, you will have no
need. How I do envy you the interest you are
going to feel in this Evelyn Byrd!”</p>

<h2 class="ch">IV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LETTING DOWN OF THE BARS</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">NOT many days after Pollard’s fruitless
talk with Kilgariff, the sergeant-major
asked leave, one morning, to
visit Orange Court House. He said nothing of
his purpose in going thither, and Pollard had
no impulse to ask him, as he certainly would
have been moved to ask any other enlisted man
under his command, especially now that the
hasty movements of troops in preparation for
the coming campaign had brought the army
into a condition resembling fermentation.</p>

<p>When Kilgariff reached the village, he inquired
for Doctor Brent’s quarters, and presently
dismounted in front of the house temporarily
occupied by that officer.</p>

<p>As he entered the office, Arthur Brent raised
his eyes, and instantly a look of amazed recognition
came over his face. Rising and grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his visitor’s hand&mdash;though that hand had not
been extended&mdash;he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Kilgariff! You here?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered the sergeant-major.
“You have taken my hand&mdash;which I did not
venture to offer. That means much.”</p>

<p>“It means that I am Arthur Brent, and glad
to greet Owen Kilgariff once more in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“It means more than that,” answered Kilgariff.
“It means that you generously believe
in my innocence&mdash;jail-bird that I am.”</p>

<p>“I have never believed you guilty,” answered
the other.</p>

<p>“But why not? The evidence was all against
me.”</p>

<p>“No, it was not. The <i>testimony</i> was. But
between evidence and testimony there is a
world of difference.”</p>

<p>“Just how do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, you and I know our chemistry. If a
score of men should swear to us that they had
seen a jet of oxygen put out fire, and a jet of
carbonic acid gas rekindle it from a dying coal,
we should instantly reject their testimony in
favour of the evidence of our own knowledge.
In the same way, I have always rejected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
testimony that convicted you, because I have,
in my knowledge of you, evidence of your innocence.
You and I were students together both
in this country and in Europe. We were friends,
roommates, comrades, day and night. I learned
to know your character perfectly, and I hold
character to be as definite a fact as complexion
is, or height, or anything else. I had the evidence
of my own knowledge of you. The testimony
contradicted it. Therefore I rejected the
testimony and believed the evidence.”</p>

<p>“Believe me,” answered Kilgariff, “I am
grateful to you for that. I did not expect it. I
ought to, but I did not. If I had reasoned as
soundly as you do, I should have known how
you would feel. But I am morbid perhaps.
Circumstances have tended to make me so.”</p>

<p>“Come with me to my bedroom upstairs,”
said Arthur Brent. “There is much that we
must talk about, and we are subject to interruption
here.”</p>

<p>Then, summoning his orderly, Arthur Brent
gave his commands:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I shall be engaged with Sergeant-major
Kilgariff upstairs for some time to come, and
I must not be interrupted on any account. Say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
so to all who may ask to see me, and peremptorily
refuse to bring me any card or any name
or any message. You understand.”</p>

<p>Then, throwing his arm around his old comrade’s
person, he led the way upstairs. When
the two were seated, Arthur Brent said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell me now about yourself. How comes
it that you are here, and wearing a Confederate
uniform?”</p>

<p>“Instead of prison stripes, eh? It is simple
enough. By a desperate effort I escaped from
Sing Sing, and after a vast deal of trouble and
some hardship, I succeeded in making my way
into the Confederate lines. Thinking to hide
myself as completely as possible, I enlisted in
a battery that has no gentlemen in its ranks,
but has a habit of getting itself into the thick
of every fight and staying there. You know
the battery&mdash;Captain Pollard’s?”</p>

<p>“Marshall Pollard’s? Yes. He is one of my
very best friends. But tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Permit me to finish. I wanted to hide myself.
I thought that as a cannonier in such a
battery I should escape all possibility of observation.
But that battery has very little material
out of which to make non-commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
officers. Very few of the men can read or
write. So it naturally came about that I was
put into place as a non-commissioned officer,
and I am now sergeant-major, greatly to my
regret. In that position I must be always with
Captain Pollard. When I learned that he and
you were intimates, and that your duty often
called you to the front, I saw the necessity of
coming to you to find out on what terms you
and I might meet after&mdash;well, in consideration
of the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Arthur Brent waited for a time before answering.
Then he stood erect, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Stand up, Owen, and let me look you in the
eyes. I have not asked you if you are innocent
of the crimes charged against you. I never shall
ask you that. I <i>know</i>, because I know <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Arthur, for putting the matter
in that way. But it is due to you&mdash;due to your
faith in me&mdash;that I should voluntarily say to
you what you refuse to ask me to say. As God
sees me, I am as innocent as you are. I could
have established my innocence at the critical
time, but I would not. To do that would
have been to condemn&mdash;well, it would have
involved&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind that. I understand. You made
a heroic self-sacrifice. Let me rejoice only in
the fact that you are free again. You are
enlisted under your own name?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I could never take an alias. It
was only when I learned that you and Captain
Pollard were friends&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But suppose you fall into the hands of the
enemy? Suppose you are made prisoner?”</p>

<p>“I shall never be taken alive,” was the
response.</p>

<p>“But you may be wounded.”</p>

<p>“I am armed against all that,” the other
replied. “I have my pistols, of course. I
carry an extra small one in my vest pocket for
emergencies. Finally, I have these”&mdash;drawing
forth two little metallic cases, one from the
right, the other from the left trousers pocket.
“They are filled with pellets of cyanide of
potassium. I carry them in two pockets to
make sure that no wound shall prevent me
getting at them. I shall not be taken alive.
Even if that should happen, however, I am
armed against the emergency. Two men escaped
from Sing Sing with me. One of them
was shot to death by the guards, his face being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fearfully mutilated. The other was wounded
and captured. The body of the dead man was
identified as mine, and my death was officially
recorded. I do not think the law of New York
would go behind that. But in any case, I am
armed against capture, and I shall never be
taken alive.”</p>

<p>A little later Arthur Brent turned the conversation.</p>

<p>“Let us talk of the future,” he said, “not of
the past. I am reorganising the medical staff
for the approaching campaign. I am sorely put
to it to find fit men for the more responsible
places. My simple word will secure for you a
commission as major-surgeon, and I will assign
you to the very best post at my disposal. I
need just such men as you are&mdash;a dozen, a
score, yes, half a hundred of them. You must
put yourself in my hands. I’ll apply for your
commission to-day, and get it within three days
at most.”</p>

<p>“If you will think a moment, Arthur,” said
the other, “you will see that I could not do
that without dishonour. Branded as I am with
a conviction of felony, I have no right to impose
myself as a commissioned officer upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
men who would never consent to associate with
me upon such terms if they knew.”</p>

<p>“I respect your scruple,” answered Doctor
Brent, after a moment of reflection, “but I do
not share it. In the first place, the disability
you mention is your misfortune, not your fault.
You <i>know</i> yourself to be innocent, and as you
do not in any way stand accused in the eyes of
the officers of this army, there is absolutely no
reason why you should not become one of them,
as a man conscious of his own rectitude.</p>

<p>“Besides all that, we are living in new times,
under different conditions from those that existed
before the war. It used to be said that in
Texas it was taking an unfair advantage of
any man to inquire into his life before his
migration to that State. If he had conducted
himself well since his arrival there, he was
entitled to all his reserves with regard to his
previous course of life in some other part of
the country. Now a like sentiment has grown
strong in the South since this war broke out.
I don’t mean to suggest that we have lowered
our standards of honourable conduct in the
least, for we have not done so. But we have
revised our judgments as to what constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
worth. The old class distinctions of birth and
heritage have given place to new tests of present
conduct. There are companies by the
score in this army whose officers, elected by
their men, were before the war persons of
much lower social position than that of a
majority of their own men. In any peacetime
organisation these officers could never have
hoped for election to office of any kind; but
they are fighters and men of capacity; they
know how to do the work of war well, and,
under our new and sounder standards of fitness,
the men in the ranks have put aside old social
distinctions and elected to command them the
men fittest to command. The same principle
prevails higher up. One distinguished
major-general in the Confederate service was a
nobody before the war; another was far worse;
he was a negro trader who before the war
would not have been admitted, even as a merely
tolerated guest, into the houses of the gentlemen
who are to-day glad to serve as officers
and enlisted men under his command. Still
another was an ignorant Irish labourer who
did work for day’s wages in the employ of
some of the men to whom he now gives orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and from whom he expects and receives willing
obedience. I tell you, Kilgariff, a revolution
has been wrought in this Southern land of ours,
and the results of that revolution will permanently
endure, whatever the military or political
outcome of the war may be. In your case there
is no need to cite these precedents, except to
show you that the old quixotism&mdash;it was a
good old quixotism in its way; it did a world of
good, together with a very little of evil&mdash;is
completely gone. There is no earthly reason,
Kilgariff, why you should not render a higher
and better service to the Confederacy than that
which you are now rendering. There is no reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Arthur; in my own mind there is
reason enough. And besides, I am thoroughly
comfortable as I am. You know I am given to
being comfortable. You remember that when
you and I were students at Jena, and afterward
in the Latin Quarter in Paris, I was always
content to live in the meagre ways that other
students did, though I had a big balance to my
credit in the bank and a large income at home.
As sergeant-major under our volunteer system,
I am the intimate associate not only of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Pollard, whose scholarship you know, but also
of all the battery officers, some of whom are
men worth knowing. For the rest, I like the
actual fighting, and I am looking forward to
this summer’s campaign with positively eager
anticipations. So, if you don’t mind, we will let
matters stand as they are. I will remain sergeant-major
till the end of it all.”</p>

<p>With that, the two friends parted.</p>

<h2 class="ch">V</h2>

<p class="pch">DOROTHY’S OPINIONS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was not Arthur Brent’s habit to rest satisfied
in the defeat of any purpose. He
was deeply interested to induce Owen
Kilgariff to become a member of the military
medical staff. Having exhausted his own resources
of persuasion, he determined to consult
Dorothy, as he always did when he needed
counsel. That night he sent a long letter to
her. In it he told her all he knew about the
matter, reserving nothing&mdash;he never practised
reserve with her&mdash;but asking her to keep Kilgariff’s
name and history to herself. Having
laid the whole matter before that wise young
woman, he frankly asked her what he should
do further in the case. For reply, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I am deeply interested in Kilgariff’s case. I have
thought all day and nearly all night about it. It
seems to me to be a case in which a man is to be
saved who is well worth saving. Not that I regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
service in the ranks as either a hardship or a shame to
any man, when the ranks are full of the best young
men in all the land. If that were all, I would not
have you turn your hand over to lift this man into
place as a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>If I interpret the matter aright, Kilgariff is simply
morbid, and if you can induce him to take the place
you have pressed upon him, you will have cured him
of his morbidity of mind. And I think you can do
that. You know how I contemn the duello, and fortunately
it seems passing out of use. In these war
times, when every man stands up every day to be
shot at by hundreds of men who are not scared, it
would be ridiculous for any man to stand up and let
one scared man shoot at him, in the hope of demonstrating
his courage in that fashion.</p>

<p>That is an aside. What I want to say is, that while
the duello has always been barbarous, and has now
become ridiculous as well, nevertheless it had some
good features, one of which I think you might use
effectively in Owen Kilgariff’s case. As I understand
the matter, it was the custom under the code duello,
sometimes to call a “court of honour” to decide in a
doubtful case precisely what honour required a man
to do, and, as I understand, the decision of such a
court was final, so far as the man whose duty was involved
was concerned. It was deemed the grossest
of offences to call in question the conduct of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
who acted in accordance with the finding of a court
of honour.</p>

<p>Now why cannot you call a court of honour to sit
upon this case? Without revealing Kilgariff’s identity&mdash;which
of course you could not do except by
his permission&mdash;you could lay before the court a succinct
but complete statement of the case, and ask it
to decide whether or not the man concerned can,
with honour, accept a commission in the service without
making the facts public. I am sure the verdict
will be in the affirmative, and armed with such a decision
you can overcome the poor fellow’s scruples and
work a cure that is well worth working.</p>

<p>Try my plan if it commends itself to your judgment,
not otherwise.</p>

<p>Little by little, I am finding out a good deal about
our Evelyn Byrd. Better still, I am learning to know
her, and she interests me mightily. She has a white
soul and a mind that it is going to be a delight to
educate. She has already read a good deal in a
strangely desultory and unguided fashion, but her
learning is utterly unbalanced.</p>

<p>For example, she has read the whole, apparently,
of the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>&mdash;in a very old edition&mdash;and
she has accepted it all as unquestionable truth.
Nobody had ever told the poor child that the science
of thirty years ago has been revised and enlarged since
that time, until I made the point clear to her singularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
quick and receptive mind in the laboratory yesterday.
She seems also to have read, and well-nigh
committed to memory, the old plays published fifty
or sixty years ago under the title of <i>The British
Drama</i>, but she has hardly so much as heard of our
great modern writers. She can repeat whole dialogues
from <i>Jane Shore</i>, <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, <i>A
New Way to Pay Old Debts</i>, <i>High Life Below Stairs</i>,
and many plays of a much lower moral character; but
even the foulest of them have manifestly done her no
harm. Her own innocence seems to have performed
the function of the feathers on a duck’s back in a
shower. She is so unconscious of evil, indeed, that I
do not care to explain my reasons to her when I suggest
that she had better not repeat to others some of
the literature that she knows by heart.</p>

<p>I still haven’t the faintest notion of her history, or
of whence she came. She is docile in an extraordinary
degree, but I think that is due in large measure to
her exaggerated sense of what she calls my goodness
to her. Poor child! It is certain that she never before
knew much of liberty or much of considerate
kindness. She seems scarcely able to realise, or even
to believe, that in anything she is really free to do as
best pleases her, a fact from which I argue that she
has been subject always to the arbitrary will of others.
She is by no means lacking in spirit, and I suspect
that those others who have arbitrarily dominated her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
life have had some not altogether pleasing experiences
with her. She is capable of very vigorous revolt
against oppression, and her sense of justice is alert.
But apparently she has never before been treated with
justice or with any regard whatever to the rights of
her individuality. She has been compelled to submit
to the will of others, but she has undoubtedly made
trouble for those who compelled her. At first with
me she seemed always expecting some correction,
some assertion of authority, and she is only now beginning
to understand my attitude toward her, especially
my insistence upon her right to decide for herself
all things that concern only herself. The other day
in the laboratory, she managed somehow to drop a
beaker and break it. She was about to gather up
the fragments, but, as the beaker had been filled
with a corrosive acid, I bade her let them alone,
saying that I would have them swept up after the
day’s work should be done. She stood staring at
me for a moment, after which she broke into a little
rippling laugh, threw her arms around my neck, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I forgot. You never scold me, even when I am
careless and break things.”</p>

<p>I tried hard to make her understand that I had no
right to scold her, besides having no desire to do so.
It seemed a new gospel to her. Finally she said,
more to herself than to me:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“It is so different here. There was never anybody
so good to me.”</p>

<p>Her English is generally excellent, but it includes
many odd expressions, some of them localisms, I
think, though I do not know whence they come. Occasionally,
too, she frames her English sentences after
a French rhetorical model, and the result is sometimes
amusing. And another habit of hers which interests
me is her peculiar use of auxiliary verbs and intensives.
Instead of saying, “I had my dinner,” she
sometimes says, “I did have my dinner,” and to-day
when we had strawberries and cream for snack, she
said, “I do find the strawberries with the cream to be
very good.”</p>

<p>Yet never once have I detected the smallest suggestion
of “broken English” in her speech, except
that now and then she places the accent on a wrong
syllable, as a foreigner might. Thus, when she first
came, she spoke of something as ex<i>cel</i>lent. I spoke
the word correctly soon afterward, and never since
has she mispronounced it. Indeed, her quickness in
learning and her exceeding conscientiousness promise
to obliterate all that is peculiar in her speech before
you get home again, unless you come quickly.</p>

<p>The girl doesn’t know what to make of Mammy.
That dearest of despots has conceived a great affection
for this new “precious chile,” and she tyrannises over
her accordingly. She refused to let her get up the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
morning until after she had taken a cup of coffee in
bed, simply because no fire had been lighted in her
room that morning. And how Mammy did scold
when she learned that Evelyn, thinking a fire unnecessary,
had sent the maid away who had gone to light
it!</p>

<p>“You’se jes’ anudder sich as Mis’ Dorothy,” she
said. “Jes’ case it’s spring yo’ won’t hab no fire to
dress by even when it’s a-rainin’. An’ so you’se a-tryin’
to cotch yo death o’ cole, jes’ to spite ole Mammy.
No, yo’ ain’t a-gwine to git up yit. Don’t you dar
try to. You’se jes’ a-gwine to lay still till dem no-’count
niggas in de dinin’-room sen’s you a cup o’
coffee what Mammy’s done tole ’em to bring jes’ as
soon as it’s ready. An’ de next time you goes fer
to stop de makin’ o’ you dressin’-fire, you’se a-gwine
to heah from Mammy, yo’ is. Jes’ you bear dat in
mind.”</p>

<p>Evelyn doesn’t quite understand. She says she
thought we controlled our servants, while in fact they
control us. But she heartily likes Mammy’s coddling
tyranny&mdash;as what rightly constructed girl could fail
to do? Do you know, Arthur, the worst thing about
this war is that there’ll never be any more old mammies
after it is ended?</p>

<p>I’m teaching Evelyn chemistry, among other things,
and she learns with a rapidity that is positively astonishing.
She has a perfect passion for precision, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
will make her invaluable in the laboratory presently.
Her deftness of hand, her accuracy, her conscientious
devotion to whatever she does, are qualities that are
hard to match. She never makes a false motion, even
when doing the most unaccustomed things; and whatever
she does, she does conscientiously, as if its doing
were the sum of human duty. I am positively fascinated
with her. If I were a man, I should fall in love
with her in a fashion that would stop not at fire or
flood. I ought to add that the girl is a marvel of
frankness&mdash;as much as any child might be&mdash;and that
her truthfulness is of the absolute, matter-of-course
kind which knows no other way. But these things you
will have inferred from what I have written before,
if I have succeeded even in a small way in describing
Evelyn’s character. I heartily wish I knew her
history; not because of feminine curiosity, but because
such knowledge might aid me in my effort to
guide and educate her aright. However, no such aid
is really necessary. With one so perfectly truthful,
and so childishly frank, I shall need only to study herself
in order to know what to do in her education.</p></div>

<p class="p1">There was a postscript to this letter, of
course. In it Dorothy wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Since this letter was written, Evelyn has revealed a
totally unsuspected accomplishment. She has been
conversing with me in French, and <i>such</i> French! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
never heard anything like it, and neither did you. It
is positively barbaric in its utter disregard of grammar,
and it includes many word forms that are half Indian,
I suspect. It interests me mightily, as an apt illustration
of the way in which new languages are formed,
little by little, out of old ones.</p>

<p class="p1">There was much else in Dorothy’s letter; for
she and her husband were accustomed to converse
as fully and as freely on paper as they did
orally when together. These two were not only
one flesh, but one in mind, in spirit, and in all
that meant life to them. Theirs was a perfect
marriage, an ideal union&mdash;a thing very rare in
this ill-assorted world of ours.</p>

<h2 class="ch">VI</h2>

<p class="pch">“WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK”</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AT midnight on the 3d of May, 1864,
a message came to General Lee’s headquarters.
It told him only of an event
which he had expected to occur about this time.
Grant was crossing the river into the Wilderness,
his army moving in two columns by way
of the two lower fords.</p>

<p>General Lee’s plans were already formed in
anticipation of this or any other movement of
the Army of the Potomac. He needed to learn
only which line of march of the several that
were open to him General Grant would adopt.
Now he knew, and instantly his orders were
given to carry out plans previously and completely
wrought out in his mind. Grant’s
movement by the lower fords indicated clearly
what his plan of campaign was to be. He had
under his orders a veteran army of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and thirty thousand men, of whom rather more
than one hundred thousand were ready for
actual battle. Lee had a total of a little less
than sixty thousand men&mdash;forty-five thousand
of whom, perhaps, he could put upon the firing-line,
with which to oppose the Federal advance.</p>

<p>Grant’s plan was to push forward rapidly
through the Wilderness before Lee could strike
a blow, turn his adversary’s right, and plant his
greatly superior army near Gordonsville, in
Lee’s rear, and between him and Richmond.
If he could have accomplished that purpose,
the surrender or destruction of the Army of
Northern Virginia would have been a matter
only of a few days, or perhaps a few hours.
For if cut off in this fashion from all its sources
of supply, and with no other army anywhere to
come to its relief, the already half-starving Virginia
force would have had no resource except
to hurl itself upon Grant’s double numbers and
shatter itself to fragments in a vain effort to
break through impregnable lines. It would
have had no possible route of retreat open to it,
no conceivable road of escape, no second line
of defence to fall back upon.</p>

<p>But General Grant was dealing with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
master of strategy of modern times. Grant’s
plan of campaign was flawless, but Robert E.
Lee stood in the way.</p>

<p>Lee instantly moved forward to interfere with
his adversary’s march toward Gordonsville, by
assailing him in flank. At the same time he
threatened his advance corps on their front, in
such fashion as to compel Grant to recall them
and accept battle amid the tangled underbrush
of the Wilderness.</p>

<p>This Wilderness is, perhaps, the very wildest
tract of land that lies anywhere east of the Mississippi.
It skirts the southern bank of the
Rapidan for fifteen miles, extending inland
from that stream for about ten miles. Originally
it was densely timbered, but in colonial
days, and a little later, the timber was cut away
to supply fuel for the iron-furnaces that once
abounded there, but that were afterward abandoned.
As the region does not at all tempt to
agriculture, the abandonment of the iron mines
left it a veritable wilderness. Its surface became
covered with densely growing scrub trees,
interlaced with a tangle of vines and imbedded,
as it were, in an undergrowth of a density inconceivable
to men who have not acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
themselves with the lavish luxuriance of Southern
vegetation.</p>

<p>It was in this Wilderness that Lee’s columns
struck Grant’s in flank, and for two days a battle
raged there, of which, for difficulty of conditions,
there is scarcely a parallel in the history
of warfare.</p>

<p>The men could not see each other at a distance
of more than a few rods. Regiments,
struggling through the tangled vines and underbrush,
came unexpectedly upon regiments of the
enemy and fought desperately for the possession
of the ground, neither knowing how much
or how little the holding, the conquest, or the
loss of the position involved might signify in a
military way.</p>

<p>Orderly fighting was utterly out of the question.
Not only was it impossible for corps commanders
to handle their troops with co-operative
intent; even brigades were so broken up, and
their several parts so hopelessly separated and
lost to each other in the thickets, that their
commanders knew neither when nor where nor
how to set one regiment to reinforce another at
a critical juncture.</p>

<p>It was a veritable Donnybrook Fair on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
large scale, where the only strategy consisted
in pushing forward, and the only tactics in
striking with all possible might at the enemy,
wherever he was found.</p>

<p>The fighting was desperate on both sides. It
was such fighting as only the most hardened
veterans could have been expected to do under
circumstances so unfavourable, such fighting as
would have been simply impossible at any
earlier stage of the war. To valour these two
armies had added discipline and long use in war.
Their determination was that of veterans, their
courage that of matchless heroes, their endurance
that of insensate machines. Here for the
first time the two greatest armies of modern history
had met in their perfection of discipline, of
experience in war, and of that high courage
which makes no distinction between the facing
of death and the confronting of a summer
shower. To these war-seasoned men on either
side the hum of bullets meant no more than the
buzzing of mosquitoes; battle, no more than a
breeze.</p>

<p>But bullets were by no means the only source
of trouble and danger. Several times during
the long struggle, the woods caught fire, literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
suffocating men by hundreds who had
passed safely through hail-storms of bullets and
successfully met and repelled charges with the
bayonet. Earthworks hastily thrown up with
pine-log revetments for their support, after enabling
the men behind them to resist and repel
successive assaults of desperate adversaries, became
themselves an irresistible foe, by the firing
of their log fronts and the consequent emanation
of a smoke too stifling for human lungs
to breathe and yet retain capacity for further
breathing. The artillery played a comparatively
small and very difficult part in all this.
Manœuvring with guns in that underbrush
was well-nigh impossible, and there were no
vantage grounds anywhere from which a gun
could deliver its fire at more than pistol-shot
range. So delivering it, either the cannon fire
quickly drove the enemy away, or the fire of the
enemy drove the gun away; and in neither case,
after that, could the artillery-men see any enemy
to shoot at.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Marshall Pollard’s battery managed
to expend the greater part of its ammunition
during those days, and that with effect.
Kilgariff was largely instrumental in this. Early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the contest Pollard had clearly seen the
difficulty&mdash;nay, the impossibility&mdash;of handling
a battery of six guns as a unit in such conditions.
He was subject to orders, of course, but
in the execution of his orders he had a certain
necessary discretion, and he exercised it. He
had only two lieutenants present for duty.
Each of these, of course, had immediate command
of a section of two guns. The third
section fell to Sergeant-major Kilgariff, as next
in command. So to him Marshall Pollard
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I cannot have you personally with me in
this fight. You have a lieutenant’s duty to do,
and I trust you to do it well. I shall try to
keep the battery together, and under my own
command so far as I can; but I foresee that it
is going to be impossible to do that completely.
I must leave each section commander to his
own discretion, in a very large degree. Frankly,
I have much greater confidence in your ability
to fight your guns for all they are worth than
I have in that of either of the lieutenants.
They are good men and true, but they have had
no experience in independent command. You&mdash;well,
anyhow, you know more than they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
So I am glad that you have the left section.
That, of course, must be the first to be detached.
The others I shall try to keep under my own
direction.”</p>

<p>Beyond a mere “Thank you, Captain,” Kilgariff
made no response. Half an hour later
his section was detached and sent to a point of
special difficulty and danger. He plunged into
action with an impetuosity which surprised General
Ewell, who was in personal command at
that point, and whose uniform habit it was to
place himself at the post of danger. But a
moment later, observing the discretion with
which Kilgariff selected a position of vantage
and planted his guns, with equal reference to
their effectiveness and their safety from capture
by a dash of the enemy, General Ewell turned
to his staff, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That young man evidently knows his business.
Who is he?”</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

<p>“Then find out,” said Ewell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kilgariff was using canister in
double charges, the range being not greater
than two hundred yards. Under this withering
fire the enemy gave way at that point, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Ewell’s whole line advanced quickly. Again
Kilgariff selected his gun position with discretion,
and opened a murderous fire upon the
enemy’s key position. But this time he did
not use canister. Still, his fire seemed to have
all the effect of canister, and his target was for
a brief while less than fifty yards distant from
the muzzles of his guns.</p>

<p>Presently Ewell himself rode up to the guns,
and asked, in his peculiarly querulous voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What ammunition are you using, Sergeant-major?”</p>

<p>“Shrapnel, doubled and fuse downward,” answered
Kilgariff. “It’s hard on the guns, I
know, but I’ve run out of canister, and must
use what I can, till a new supply comes. I’ve
sent for it.”</p>

<p>It should be explained that shrapnel consists
of a thin, hollow shell of iron, filled with leaden
bullets. In the centre of each shell is a small
charge of powder, intended only to open the
shell twenty-five yards or so in front of an enemy’s
line, and let the leaden bullets with their
initial impetus hurl themselves like hailstones
into the faces of the troops. But Kilgariff was
turning his shrapnel shells reverse way, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
their fuses toward the powder charge, so that
the fuses should be melted at the moment of
firing, and the shells explode within the gun,
thus making them serve the purpose of canister,
which consists of tin cans filled with iron
balls.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn that trick?” queried
Ewell.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose every artillery-man knows it,”
answered the sergeant-major, evasively. “But
here comes a fresh supply of canister, so I may
spare the guns.”</p>

<p>At that moment a rifled gun of the enemy,
posted upon a hill eight or nine hundred yards
away, opened upon Kilgariff, through a gap in
the forest, threatening, by the precision of its
fire, either to dismount his guns or to compel his
retirement from the position he had chosen. Instantly
he ordered one of his Napoleons to reply.
It did so, but without effect. After it had fired
three shots to no purpose, Kilgariff went to the
gun, bade the gunner stand aside, and himself
aimed the piece, with as much of calm in his
demeanour as if he had not been under a double
fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-088.jpg" width="400" height="484" id="i89"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption2"><p class="dci2"><i>“WHO ARE<br />YOU?”</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun was discharged, while Ewell watched
the effect through a field-glass. The shell
seemed to strike immediately under the muzzle
of the enemy’s gun, and to explode at the very
moment of striking. When the smoke of its explosion
cleared away, Ewell saw through his
glass that the enemy’s gun had been dismounted,
its carriage destroyed, and the men serving it
swept out of existence. Dismounting, he walked
up to Kilgariff, and asked simply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Owen Kilgariff, sergeant-major of Captain
Marshall Pollard’s Virginia battery.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ewell, remounting as he
issued orders for another charge along his entire
line.</p>

<p>On both days, night ended the conflict, for
the time at least, and the first duty of officers
great and small, after darkness set in each evening,
was to get their commands together as best
they could and reorganise them for the next
day’s work.</p>

<p>On the Confederate side, it was confidently
expected, after the two days’ fighting, that the
next day’s work would consist in vigorously
pressing the rear of Grant’s columns on their
retreat across the river. For every soldier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the Army of Northern Virginia regarded such
retreat as inevitable, and the only difference of
opinion among them was as to what General
Lee would do next. The general expectation
was that he would almost instantly move by his
left flank for another invasion of Maryland and
Pennsylvania, another threatening of Washington
City.</p>

<p>And there was good ground of precedent for
these Confederate expectations. Lee had undoubtedly
inflicted a severer punishment upon
Grant than he had before done upon McClellan,
Pope, Burnside, or Hooker, and moreover he had
completely baffled Grant’s plan of campaign,
thwarting his attempt to turn the Confederate
right and plant his army in the Confederate
rear near Gordonsville. Four times the Army
of Northern Virginia had seen its adversary
retreat and assume the defensive after less disastrous
defeats than that which the Southerners
were confident they had inflicted upon Grant in
these two days’ desperate work. Why should
they not expect Grant, therefore, to retreat across
the river, as all his predecessors had done under
like circumstances? And why should not Lee
again assume the right to decide where and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
when and how the struggle should be renewed,
as he had done three times before?</p>

<p>The fallacy in all this lay in its failure to
recognise Grant’s quality, in its assumption that
he was another McClellan, another Pope, another
Burnside, another Hooker.</p>

<p>Between him and his predecessors there was
this fundamental difference: they set out to force
their way to Richmond by strategy and fighting,
and when they found themselves outmanœuvred
and badly damaged in battle, they gave up their
aggressive attempts and contented themselves
with operations for the defence of the Federal
capital; Grant had set out to conquer or destroy
Lee’s army by the use of a vastly superior force
whose losses could be instantly made good by
reinforcements, while Lee had nowhere any
source from which to draw fresh troops, and
when Grant found his first attempt baffled and
his columns badly damaged in fight, he obstinately
remained where he was, sent for reinforcements,
and made his preparations to “fight
it out on this line if it takes all summer.”</p>

<p>Thus, in Grant’s character and temperament
the Confederates had a totally new condition to
meet. And there was another supremely important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fact governing this campaign. Grant
was the first commander of the Army of the
Potomac who also and at the same time controlled
all the other Federal armies in the field.
These he directed with sole reference to his
one supreme strategic purpose&mdash;the purpose,
namely, of destroying the Army of Northern
Virginia and making an end of the tremendous
resisting power of Robert E. Lee. In that
resisting power he, first of all men, saw clearly
that the vitality of the Confederate cause had
its being.</p>

<p>In order that he might destroy that, he had
not only concentrated a mightily superior force
against it, and arranged to keep the strength of
his own army up to its maximum by heavy reinforcement
after every battle loss, but he had
also ordered all the Federal armies in other parts
of the country to carry on such operations as
should continually occupy every Confederate
force and forbid Lee to reinforce the Virginia
army from any quarter as its numbers should
decline by reason of battle losses.</p>

<p>Grant directed Sherman to begin the Atlanta
campaign simultaneously with the beginning of
the year’s work on the Rapidan. He ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Thomas to hold East Tennessee, and to operate
in such fashion as to occupy all the Confederate
forces there. He ordered the Federal armies
west of the Mississippi to abandon their wasteful
operations in that quarter, concentrate in
New Orleans, and move at once upon Mobile, in
order to prevent Lee from drawing troops from
the Far South.</p>

<p>He filled the valley of Virginia with forces
sufficient to compel Lee to keep a strong army
corps there, instead of calling it to his assistance
in Northern Virginia. He sent Butler to the
James River region below Richmond, by way of
compelling Lee to keep strong detachments at
Richmond and Petersburg, which otherwise he
might have called to his assistance in the crucial
struggle with the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>As one looks back at all this, and clearly discerns
Grant’s purpose and the means he used
for its accomplishment, it is easy to see that
both Lee and the Confederate cause were
doomed in the very hour of Grant’s passage
across the Rapidan. The only chance of any
other issue lay in the remote possibility that
the sixty thousand men of the Army of Northern
Virginia should inflict a decisive and destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
defeat upon the one hundred and thirty
thousand men of the Army of the Potomac at
the outset of the campaign, and in that way
bring hopeless discouragement at the North to
their aid.</p>

<p>This they did not succeed in doing at the
Wilderness, and when, after two days’ battling
there, Grant moved by his left flank to Spottsylvania
Court House to join battle again, there
was scarcely a veteran in the Virginia army
who did not fully understand that the beginning
of the end had come. Yet not one of them
flinched from the further fighting because of
its manifest hopelessness. Not one of them lost
the courage of despair in losing hope. Perhaps
there was no part of the titanic struggle which
so honourably distinguished those men of the
South as did that campaign in which they doggedly
fought on after they had come to understand
that their fighting was futile.</p>

<p>It is natural enough that men should be brave
when the lure of hope and the confident expectation
of victory beckon them to the battle
front, but only men of most heroic mould may
be expected to fight with still greater desperation
after all doors of hope are closed to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>From that hour when Grant moved from the
Wilderness to Spottsylvania till the end came,
nearly a year later, these men of the South did,
and dared, and endured for love of honour
alone, with no hope to inspire them, no remotest
chance of ultimate success as the reward
of their valour. Theirs was a pure heroism,
untouched, untainted, unalloyed.</p>

<p>After two days of such fighting as bulldogs
do, the struggle in the Wilderness ended with
no decisive advantage on either side. Grant
had secured possession of roads leading out of
the Wilderness. On the other hand Lee had
succeeded in completely baffling his adversary’s
strategic purpose, and was still in full possession
of that region in his own rear which Grant
had hoped to seize upon with decisive effect.
Grant’s losses in killed, wounded, and prisoners
greatly exceeded Lee’s; but as an offset, he
could afford to lose more heavily than the Confederates,
not only because his force outnumbered
Lee’s by more than two to one, but also
because he could repair all his losses by reinforcement,
while Lee had no such resource.</p>

<p>Baffled, but not beaten, Grant decided, on the
evening of the 7th of May, to move to the left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
passing out of the Wilderness and taking up
a new position&mdash;strong both for attack and
defence&mdash;on a line of hills near Spottsylvania
Court House. It was his hope to possess himself
of this position before Lee should discover
his purpose, and to that end he began his march
after nightfall, pushing strong columns forward
by all available roads, while still ostentatiously
holding his positions in the Confederate front,
as if to renew the battle in the Wilderness the
next morning.</p>

<p>But his wily adversary anticipated the movement,
and discovered it almost as soon as it was
begun. Lee sent his cavalry and a considerable
force of infantry to fell trees across the roads
and otherwise obstruct the march of Grant’s
column. Meanwhile, with his main body, he
moved in haste to Spottsylvania Court House.
The head of his column reached that point in
advance of Grant, and promptly seized upon
the coveted line of hills which the men, accustomed
to such work, proceeded hastily to fortify,
fighting, meanwhile, with such of the
Federal commands as had come up to dispute
their possession of the strategic position.</p>

<p>It was during this preliminary struggle that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
certain little hill in front of the main ridge fell
into hot dispute. Its possession by the Federals
would greatly weaken the Confederate line, and
it was deemed essential by the Confederate commanders
present to secure it at all hazards,
while the Federals, seeing the importance of
the little hill, concentrated the fire of twenty
guns upon it, sweeping its top as with a broom,
whenever a Confederate force, large or small,
showed itself there.</p>

<p>Three times Confederate infantry were advanced
to the crest, and three times they were
driven back by a storm of cannon shot before
they could throw up a dozen shovelfuls of earth.</p>

<p>Kilgariff, again detached with his two guns,
sat upon his horse, looking on at all this and
wondering what the result would be. Presently
a brigade of North Carolinians moved up into
line just in front of him, at the moment when
the third of the charging bodies was hurled back,
baffled, beaten, and broken into fragments.</p>

<p>Just then the chief of artillery of the corps
with which Kilgariff was temporarily serving
rode up and said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you want your opportunity for distinction
and a commission?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want all the opportunity I can get to render
service,” was Kilgariff’s answer.</p>

<p>“Then take your guns to the crest of that
hill and <i>stay there</i>!” fairly shouted the officer.</p>

<p>Kilgariff fully realised the desperate character
of the attempt, and the practical certainty
that his guns, his men, and his horses would be
quickly swept off the face of the earth when he
should appear upon that shell-furrowed hilltop.
But he had no thought of faltering. On the
contrary, just as he gave the order, “Forward,”
a whimsical thought occurred to him. “The
general need not have been at the trouble to
order us to ‘stay there.’ We’ll stay there,
whether we wish to or not. The enemy will
take care of that.” Then came the more serious
thought that unless he could bring his guns
into battery almost instantly upon reaching the
hilltop, the slaughter of his horses might prevent
the proper placing of the pieces. So, at
a full run, he carried the guns up the slope,
shouting the orders, “Fire to the front! In
battery!” at the moment of coming within
sight of the Federal guns, less than half a thousand
yards away, and already partially protected
by a hastily constructed earthwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately, the men of Captain Pollard’s
battery were perfect in drill to their very finger
tips, and their alert precision brought the
guns into position within a second or two, and
the twelve-pounders were bellowing before the
horses began falling just in the rear.</p>

<p>Kilgariff ordered the horses and caissons to
be retired a little way down the hill, for the
sake of such protection as the ground afforded,
but scarcely one of the animals lived to enjoy
such protection even briefly.</p>

<p>Meantime, Kilgariff, dismounted now (for
his horse had been the first to fall), stood there
working his two utterly unsupported guns under
the fiercely destructive fire of a score of pieces
on the enemy’s side. His men fell one after
another, like autumn leaves in a gale. Within
half a minute he had called all the drivers to
the guns to take the places of their dead or
dying comrades, and still each gun was being
operated by a detachment too scant in numbers
for effectiveness of fire.</p>

<p>It was obviously impossible that any of them
could long survive under a fire so concentrated
and so terrific. Kilgariff reckoned upon three
minutes as the utmost time that any man there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
could live; and when one of his guns was
dismounted at its fifth discharge, and two of his
limber-chests exploded almost at the same
moment, he hastily counted the cannoniers left
to him and found their number to be just seven,
all told.</p>

<p>But he had not been ordered to undertake
this desperate enterprise without a purpose.
Reckoning upon the almost superstitious reverence
that the infantry cherish for cannon, the
generals in command had sent Kilgariff’s guns
into this caldron of fire as a means of luring the
infantry to a desperate attempt to take and hold
the little hill. Before Kilgariff had traversed
half the distance toward the crest, the commander
of that North Carolina brigade had
called out a message that was quickly passed
from mouth to mouth down his line. The message
was:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We must save those guns and hold that hill.
They call us tar heels. Let us show <i>how tar
sticks</i>.”</p>

<p>Instantly, and with a yell that might have
come from the throats of so many demons, the
brigade of about two thousand men bent their
heads forward, rushed up the hill, and swarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
around Kilgariff’s guns. Their deployment into
line quickly diverted the enemy’s attention to
a larger front. Other guns were hurriedly
brought up to the hill, and half an hour later
a substantial line of earthworks covered its
crest.</p>

<p>The three minutes that Kilgariff had allowed
for the complete destruction of his little command
were scarcely gone when this relief came.
He was ordered to withdraw his remaining gun
by hand down the hill&mdash;by hand, for the reason
that not a horse remained of the thirty odd that
had so lately galloped up the steep.</p>

<h2 class="ch">VII</h2>

<p class="pch">WITH EVELYN AT WYANOKE</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AS if bearing a charmed life, Kilgariff
had gone through all this without a
scratch. He had galloped up that hill
in the face of a heavy infantry fire; he had
planted his section under the murderous cannonading
of twenty well-served guns firing at
point-blank range; he had fought his pieces
under a bombardment so fierce that within the
brief space of three minutes his command was
well-nigh destroyed. Yet not a scratch of bullet
or shell-fragment had so much as rent his
uniform.</p>

<p>By one of those grim jests of which war is
full, he fell after all this was over, his neck
pierced and torn by a stray bullet that had
missed its intended billet in front and sped on
in search of some human target in the rear.</p>

<p>He was carried immediately to one of the
field-hospitals which Doctor Arthur Brent was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
hurriedly establishing just in rear of the newly
formed line of defence. There he fell into Doctor
Brent’s own friendly hands; for that officer,
the moment he saw who the patient was, left
his work of supervision and himself knelt over
the senseless form of the sergeant-major to discover
the extent of his injury and to repair it
if possible. He found it to be severe, but not
necessarily fatal. He proceeded to stop the
dangerous hemorrhage, cleansed and dressed
the wound, and within half an hour Kilgariff
regained consciousness.</p>

<p>A few hours later, finding that the temporary
hospital was exposed to both artillery and musketry
fire, Doctor Brent ordered the removal of
the wounded men to a point a mile or so in the
rear; and finding Kilgariff, thanks to his elastic
constitution, able to endure a little longer journey,
he took him to his own quarters, still
farther to the rear.</p>

<p>Here Captain Pollard managed to visit his
sergeant-major during the night.</p>

<p>“General Anderson, who is in command of
Longstreet’s corps, now that Longstreet is
wounded,” he said, during the interview, “has
asked for your report of your action on the hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
If you are strong enough to answer a question
or two, I’ll make the report in your stead.”</p>

<p>“I think I can write it myself,” answered
Kilgariff; “and I had rather do that.”</p>

<p>Paper and a pencil were brought, and, with
much difficulty, the wounded man wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Under orders this day, I took the left section of
Captain Pollard’s Virginia Battery to the crest of a
hill in front.</p>

<p>After three minutes of firing, infantry having come
up, I was ordered to retire, and did so. My losses
were eighteen men killed and fifteen wounded, of a
total force of thirty-eight men. One of my gun carriages
was destroyed by an enemy’s shell, and two
limber-chests were blown up. All of the horses having
fallen, I brought off the remaining gun and the
two caissons by hand, in obedience to orders. I was
fortunately able also to bring off all the wounded.
Every man under my command behaved to my satisfaction.</p>

<p class="pr4">All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>
<p class="pr3"><span class="smcap">Owen Kilgariff</span>,</p>
<p class="pr2"><i>Sergeant-major</i>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">“Is that all you wish to say?” asked Pollard,
when he had read the report.</p>

<p>“Quite all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“You make no mention of your own wound.”</p>

<p>“That was received later. It has no proper
place in this report.”</p>

<p>“True. That is for me to mention in my report
for the day.”</p>

<p>But in his indorsement upon the sergeant-major’s
report Pollard wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I cannot too highly commend to the attention of
the military authorities the extraordinary courage, devotion,
and soldierly skill manifested by Sergeant-major
Kilgariff, both in this affair and in the fighting
of the last few days in the Wilderness.</p>

<p class="p1">In the meantime General Ewell had mentioned
in one of his reports the way in which
Kilgariff had done his work in the Wilderness,
and now General Anderson wrote almost enthusiastically
in commendation of this young
man’s brilliant and daring action, so that when
the several reports reached General Lee’s headquarters,
the great commander was deeply impressed.
Here was a young enlisted man whose
conduct in action had been so conspicuously
gallant and capable as to attract favourable
mention from two corps commanders within
a brief period of three or four days. General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Lee officially recommended that a captain’s
commission should be issued at once to a man
so deserving of promotion and so fit to command.</p>

<p>The document did not reach Kilgariff until a
fortnight later, after Arthur Brent had sent him
to Wyanoke for treatment and careful nursing.
Kilgariff took the commission in his enfeebled
hands and carefully read it through, seeming to
find some species of pleasure in perusing the
formal words with which he was already familiar.
Across the sheet was written in red ink:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">This commission is issued in accordance with the
request of General R. E. Lee, commanding, in recognition
of gallant and meritorious conduct in battle.</p>

<p class="p1">That rubric seemed especially to please the
sick man. For a moment it brought light to
his eyes, but in the next instant a look of
trouble, almost of despair, overspread his face.</p>

<p>“Send it back,” he said to Evelyn, who was
watching by the side of the couch that had been
arranged for him in the broad, breeze-swept hall
at Wyanoke. “Send it back; I do not want it.”</p>

<p>Ever since Kilgariff’s removal to the house of
the Brents, Evelyn had been his nurse and companion,
tireless in her attention to his comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
when he was suffering, and cheerily entertaining
at those times when he was strong enough
to engage in conversation.</p>

<p>“You know, it was he who took me out of
the burning house,” she said to Dorothy, by way
of explanation, not of apology; for in the innocent
sincerity of her nature, she did not understand
or believe that there can ever be need of
an apology for the doing of any right thing.</p>

<p>For one thing, she was accustomed to write
the brief and infrequent letters that Kilgariff
wished written. These were mostly in acknowledgment
of letters of inquiry and sympathy
that came to him from friends in the army.</p>

<p>Usually he dictated the notes to her, and she
wrote them out in a hand that was as legible as
print and not unlike a rude print in appearance.
At first glance her manuscript looked altogether
masculine, by reason of the breadth of stroke
and the size of the letters, but upon closer scrutiny
one discovered in it many little peculiarities
that were distinctly feminine.</p>

<p>Kilgariff asked her one day:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who taught you to write, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. Nobody ever taught me much of
anything till I came to live at Wyanoke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“How, then, did you learn to read and write,
and especially to spell so well?”</p>

<p>The girl appeared frightened a bit by these
questions, which seemed to be master keys of
inquiry into the mystery of her early life. Kilgariff,
observing her hesitation, said quickly but
very gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There, little girl, don’t answer my ‘sick
man’s’ questions. I didn’t mean to ask them.
They are impertinent.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said reflectively, “nothing that
comes from you can be impertinent, I reckon,”&mdash;for
she was rapidly adopting the dialect of
the cultivated Virginians. “You see, you took
me out of that house afire, and so you have a
right&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I claim no right whatever, Evelyn,” he said,
“and you must quit thinking about that little
incident up there on the Rapidan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I can never quit thinking about
that. You were great and good, and oh, so
strong! and you did the best thing that ever
anybody did for me.”</p>

<p>“But I would have done the same for a
negro.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t do it for a negro. You did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it for me. So you see I am right about it. Am
I not?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Your logic is a trifle lame,
perhaps, but your heart is right. Never mind
that now.”</p>

<p>“But I want to tell you all I can,” the girl
resumed. “You see, I can’t tell you much,
because I don’t know much about myself, and
because they made me swear. But I can answer
this question of yours. I don’t know just how
I learned to read. I reckon somebody must have
taught me that when I was so little that I have
forgotten all about it. Anyhow, I don’t remember.
But after I had read a good many books,
there came a time when I couldn’t get any
books, except three that I was carrying with
me. That was when I was a little boy, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A little boy? A little girl, you mean.”</p>

<p>“No, I mean a little boy, but I mustn’t tell
you about that, only I have already told you that
once I was a little boy. It slipped out, and you
must forget it, please, for I didn’t mean to say
it. I wasn’t really a boy, of course, but I had to
wear a boy’s clothes and a boy’s name. Never
mind that. You mustn’t ask me about it. As
I was saying, when I grew tired of reading my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
three books over and over again, I decided to
write some new ones for myself. The only
trouble was that I had never learned to write.
That didn’t bother me much, because I had seen
writing and had read a little of it sometimes; so
I knew that it was just the same as print, only
that the letters were made more carelessly and
some of them just a little differently in shape.
I knew I could do it, after a little practice. I
got some eagle’s quills from&mdash;” here the girl
checked herself, and bit her lip. Presently she
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I got some eagle’s quills from a man who
had them, and I made myself some pens. I had
some blank-books that had been partly written
in at the&mdash;well, partly written in. But there
wasn’t any ink there, so I made myself some
out of oak bark and nutgalls, ‘setting’ the colour
with copperas, as I had seen the people at the&mdash;well,
as I had seen somebody do it in that way.
It made very good ink, and I soon taught myself
how to write. As for the spelling, I tried to
remember how all the words looked in the books
I had read, and when I couldn’t remember, I
would stop writing and look through the three
books I still had till I came upon the word I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wanted. After that, I never had any trouble
about spelling that word.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine not,” said Kilgariff. “But
did you succeed in writing any books for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, two of them.”</p>

<p>“What were they about?”</p>

<p>“Well, in one of them I wrote all I could
remember about myself; they got hold of that
and threw it into the fire.”</p>

<p>“Who did that?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;well, the people I was with&mdash;no, I
mustn’t tell you about them. In another of my
books I wrote all I had learned about birds and
animals and trees and other things. I reckon
I know a good deal about such things, but what
I wrote was only what I had learned for myself
by seeing so much of them. You see, I was
alone a good deal then, except for the wild
creatures, and I got pretty well acquainted with
them. Even here, where they never knew me,
I can call birds or squirrels to me out of the
trees, and they soon get so they will come to
me even without my calling them.”</p>

<p>“Is that book in existence still?” asked Kilgariff,
with manifest eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon so, but maybe not. I really don’t
know. Anyhow, I shall never see it again, of
course, and nobody else would care for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, somebody else would. I would give
a thousand dollars in gold for it at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Why, what for? It was only a childish
thing, and besides I had never studied about
such things.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” interrupted Kilgariff. “Do you
know where science comes from, and what it is?
Do you realise that absolutely every fact we
know, of the kind we call scientific, was originally
found out just by somebody’s looking and
listening as you did with your animals and birds
and flowers? And the persons who looked and
listened and thought about what they saw, told
other people about them in books, and so all our
science was born? Those other people have put
things together and given learned names to
them, and classified the facts for convenience,
but the ones who did the observing have always
been the discoverers, the most profitable workers
in science. Audubon was reckoned an idle,
worthless fellow by the commonplace people
about him, because he ‘wasted his time’ roaming
about in the woods, making friends of the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
creatures and studying their habits. But scientific
men, who are not commonplace or narrow-minded,
were glad to listen when this idle fellow
told them what he had learned in the woods.
In Europe and America the great learned societies
never tired of heaping honours upon him
and the books he wrote; and the pictures he
painted of his woodland friends sold for fabulous
sums, bringing him fame and fortune.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” answered the girl, simply;
“for I like Audubon. I’ve been reading his
<i>Birds of America</i>, since I came to Wyanoke.
But I am not Audubon, and my poor, childish
writings are not great like his.”</p>

<p>“They are if they record, as they must, observations
that nobody else had made before.
On the chance of that, I would give a thousand
dollars in gold, as I said before, for that childish
manuscript. Could you not reproduce it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; never. Of course, I remember all
the things I put into it, but I set them down so
childishly&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You set them down truthfully, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;but not in any proper order. I
just wrote in my book each day the new things
I had seen or learned or thought. Mostly I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
interested in finding out what animals think, and
how or in what queer ways plants behave under
certain circumstances. There was nothing in all
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There was everything in all that, and it was
worth everything. But of course, as you say,
you cannot reproduce the book&mdash;not now at
least. Perhaps some day you may.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand?” queried the girl.
“If I can’t rewrite the book now&mdash;and I certainly
can’t&mdash;how shall I ever be able to do it
‘some day’? Before ‘some day’ comes I shall
have forgotten many things that I remember
now.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not forget anything of vital
interest. But now you are self-conscious and
therefore shy and self-distrustful, as you were
not in your childhood when you wrote the book,
and as you will not be when you grow into a
maturer womanhood and learn to be less impressed
by what you now think the superiority
of others. When that time comes, you will
write the book again, adding much to its store
of observed facts, for you are not going to stop
observing any more than you are going to stop
thinking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Evelyn shook her head.</p>

<p>“I could never write a book&mdash;a real book,
I mean&mdash;fit to be printed.”</p>

<p>“We shall see about that later,” said Kilgariff.
“You are a young woman of unusual
intellectual gifts, and under Mrs. Brent’s influence
you will grow, in ways that you do not now
imagine.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff was profoundly interested, and he
was rapidly talking himself into a fever. Evelyn
was quick to see this, and she was also anxious
to escape further praise and further talk about
herself. So, with a demure little air of authority,
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You must stop talking now. It is very bad
for you. You must take a few sips of broth and
then a long sleep.”</p>

<p>All this occurred long after the day when
Kilgariff handed her his captain’s commission
and bade her “send it back,” saying, “I don’t
want it.” At that time she was wholly ignorant
of military formalities. She did not know that
under military usage Kilgariff could not communicate
with the higher authorities except formally
and “through the regular channels”;
that is to say, through a succession of officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
beginning with his captain. She saw that this
commission was dated at the adjutant-general’s
office in Richmond and signed, “S. Cooper, Adjutant-general.”
Nothing could be simpler, she
thought, than to relieve Kilgariff of all trouble
in the matter by herself sending the document
back, with a polite note to Mr. S. Cooper. So
she wrote the note as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">S. Cooper</span>, Adj’t-general,</p>
<p class="pi4">Richmond.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sergeant-major Kilgariff is too weak from his wound
to write his own letters, so I’m writing this note for
him, to send back the enclosed paper. Mr. Kilgariff
doesn’t want it, but he thanks you for your courtesy
in sending it.</p>

<p class="pr8">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Evelyn Byrd</span>.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Precisely what would have happened if this extraordinary
note with its enclosure had reached
the adjutant-general of the army, in response to
his official communication, it is difficult to imagine.
Fortunately, Evelyn was puzzled to know
whether she should write on the envelope, “Mr.
S. Cooper,” or “S. Cooper, Esq.” So she waited
till Kilgariff should be awake and able to instruct
her on that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>When he saw what she had written, his first
impulse was to cry out in consternation. His
second was to laugh aloud. But he did neither.
Instead, he quietly said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We must be a little more formal, dear, and
do this business in accordance with military etiquette.
You see, these official people are very
exacting as to formalities.”</p>

<p>Then he wrote upon the official letter which
had accompanied the commission a respectful
indorsement declining the commission, after
which he directed his secretary-nurse to address
it formally to Captain Marshall Pollard, who,
he explained, would indorse it and forward it
through the regular channels, as required by
military usage.</p>

<p>“But why not accept the commission?” asked
Evelyn, simply. She did not at all realise&mdash;and
Kilgariff had taken pains that she should not
realise&mdash;the enormity of her blunder or the ludicrousness
of it. “Isn’t it better to be a captain
than a sergeant-major?”</p>

<p>“For most men, yes,” answered Kilgariff;
“but not for me.”</p>

<p>But he did not explain.</p>

<h2 class="ch">VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SOME REVELATIONS OF EVELYN</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the meanwhile Arthur Brent had acted
upon Dorothy’s suggestion. He had prepared
a careful statement of Kilgariff’s
case, withholding his name of course, and had
submitted it to General Stuart, with the request
that that typical exemplar of all that was best
in chivalry should himself choose such officers
as he deemed best, to constitute the court.</p>

<p>The verdict was unanimous. Stuart wrote to
Arthur Brent:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Every member of the court is of opinion that
your own assurance of the innocence of the gentleman
concerned is conclusive. They are all of opinion that
he is entirely free and entitled to accept a commission,
and that he is not under the slightest obligation to
reveal to anybody the unfortunate circumstances that
have caused him to hesitate in this matter. It is the
further opinion of the court, and I am asked to express
it with emphasis, that the course of the gentleman
concerned, in refusing to accept a commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon the point of honour that influenced him to that
decision, is in itself a sufficient assurance of his character.
Tell him from me that, without at all knowing
who he is, I urge and, if I may, I command him to
accept the post you offer him, in order that he may
render his best services to the cause that we all love.</p>

<p class="p1">Arthur Brent hurried this letter to his friend
at Wyanoke; but before it arrived, the writer
of it, the “Chevalier of the Lost Cause,” had
passed from earth. He fell at the Yellow
Tavern, at the head of his troopers in one of
the tremendous onsets which he knew so well
how to lead, before this generous missive&mdash;perhaps
the last that he ever wrote&mdash;fell under
the eyes of the man, all unknown to him, whom
he thus commanded to accept honour and duty
with it.</p>

<p>The fact of Stuart’s death peculiarly embarrassed
a man of Kilgariff’s almost boyish sensitiveness.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I feel [he wrote to Arthur Brent] as if I were
disobeying Stuart’s commands and disregarding his
dying request, in still refusing to reconsider my decision.
Yet I feel that I must do so in spite of the
decision of your court of honour, in spite of your
friendly insistence, in spite of everything. After all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Arthur, a man must be judge in his own case, when
his honour is involved. The most that others can do&mdash;the
most even that a court of honour can do&mdash;is
to excuse, to pardon, to permit. I could never submit
to the humiliation of excuse, of pardon, of permission,
however graciously granted. I sincerely wish
you could understand me, Arthur. In aid of that, let
me state the case. I am a man condemned on an
accusation of crime. I am an escaped prisoner, a
fugitive from justice. I am innocent. I know that,
and you are generous enough to believe it. But the
hideous fact of my conviction remains. It seems to
me that even upon the award of a court of honour,
backed by something like the dying injunction of our
gallant cavalier, Stuart, I cannot honourably consent
to accept a commission and meet men of stainless
reputation upon equal terms, or perhaps even as their
superior and commanding officer, without first revealing
to each and all of them the ugly facts that stand
in the way. Generous they may be; generous they
are. But it is not for me to impose myself upon their
generosity, or to deceive them by a reserve which I
am bound to practise.</p>

<p class="pbq">I have already sent back a captain’s commission
which I had fairly won by that little fight on the hill
at Spottsylvania. With you I may be frank enough to
say that any sergeant-major doing what I did on that
occasion would have been entitled to his captaincy as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a matter of right, and not at all as a matter of favour.
I had fairly won that commission, yet I returned it to
the war department, simply because I could not forget
the facts in my case. How much more imperative
it is that I should refuse the higher commission which
you press upon me, and which I have not won by any
conspicuous service! Will you not understand me,
my friend? Will you not try to look at this matter
from my point of view? So long as I am a condemned
criminal, a fugitive from justice, I simply
cannot consent to become a commissioned officer entitled
by my government’s certification to meet on
equal terms men against whom no accusation has
been laid.</p>

<p class="pbq">Let that matter rest here. I shall remain a sergeant-major
to the end&mdash;an enlisted man, a non-commissioned
officer whose captain may send him
back to the gun whenever it pleases him to do so, a
man who must touch his cap to every officer he meets,
a man subject to orders, a man ready for any work of
war that may be given him to do. In view of the
tedious slowness with which I am recovering from this
wound, and the great need I know Captain Pollard
has for an executive sergeant, I wrote to him, two
weeks ago, resigning my place, and asking him to
select some other capable man in my stead. He
replied in his generous fashion, absolutely refusing
to accept my resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">That was Kilgariff’s modest way of putting
the matter. What Pollard had actually written
was this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">By your gallantry and your capacity as a hard-fighting
soldier, you have won for my battery such honour
and distinction as had not come to it from all its previous
good conduct. Do you imagine that I am going
to lose such a sergeant-major as you are, merely because
his honourable wounds temporarily incapacitate
him? I had thought to lose you by your richly earned
promotion to a rank equal to my own, or superior to
it. That promotion you have refused&mdash;foolishly, I
think&mdash;but at any rate you have refused it. You are
still my sergeant-major, therefore, and will remain that
until you consent to accept a higher place.</p>

<p class="p1">This was the situation so far as Kilgariff was
concerned, as it revealed itself to Pollard and
Arthur Brent. Dorothy knew another side of
it. For with Dorothy, Kilgariff had quickly
established relations of the utmost confidence
and the truest friendship; and to Dorothy, Kilgariff
revealed every thought, as he had never
done to any other human being.</p>

<p>Indeed, revelation was not necessary. Dorothy
was a woman of that high type that loves
sincerely and with courage, and Dorothy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
seen the daily and hourly growing fascination
of Kilgariff for Evelyn. She had seen Evelyn’s
devoted ministry to him, and had understood
the unconscious love that lay behind its childlike
reserve. She had understood, as he had
not, that, all unknown to herself, Evelyn had
made of Kilgariff the hero of her adoration, and
that Kilgariff’s soul had been completely enthralled
by a devotion which did not recognise
its own impulse or the fulness of its meaning.
Dorothy knew far more, indeed, of the relations
between these two than either of themselves
had come to know.</p>

<p>She was in no way unprepared, therefore,
when one day Kilgariff said to her, as they two
sat in converse:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You know, of course, that I am deeply in
love with Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Dorothy answered; “I must be blind
if I did not see that.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” responded the man, “I have said
nothing to her on the subject, and I shall say
nothing, to the end. I speak to you of it only
because I want your help in avoiding the danger-point.
Evelyn is not in the least in love with
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorothy made no response to that.</p>

<p>“She is grateful to me for having saved her
life, and gratitude is a sentiment utterly at war
with love. Moreover, Evelyn is perfectly frank
and unreserved in her conversations with me.
No woman is ever so with the man she loves,
until after he has made her his wife. So I regard
Evelyn, as for the present, safe. She is
not in love with me, and I shall do nothing to
induce such sentiment on her part.”</p>

<p>Again Dorothy sat silent.</p>

<p>“But there is much that I can do for her,
and I want to do it. You must help me. And
above all you must tell me the moment you discover
in her any shadow or trace of that reserve
toward me which might mean or suggest a
dawning of love. I shall be constantly on the
lookout for such signs, but you, with your
woman’s wit and intuitions, may be quicker
than I to see.”</p>

<p>“Precisely what do you mean, Kilgariff?”
Dorothy asked, in her frank way of going
directly to the marrow of every matter with
which she had occasion to deal. “You say
you are in love with Evelyn. Do you not wish
her to be in love with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! By every consideration of propriety,
by every sentiment of honour, no!” he answered,
with more of vehemence than he was accustomed
to put into his words.</p>

<p>“Do you not understand? I can never ask
her to marry me; I am therefore in honour
bound not to win her love. I shall devote myself
most earnestly to the task of repairing such
defects in her education as I discover. But the
moment I see or suspect the least disposition
on her part to think of me otherwise than
with the indifference of mere friendship, I
shall take myself out of her life completely.
I ask you to aid me in watching for such
indications of dawning affection, and in forestalling
them.”</p>

<p>“You shall have all the assistance you need
to discover and do your real duty,” said Dorothy.
But that most womanly of women did not at all
share Kilgariff’s interpretation either of his own
duty or of Evelyn’s sentiment toward him. She
knew from her own experience that a woman
grows shy and reserved with a man the moment
she understands herself to be in love with him.
But equally she knew that love may long conceal
itself even from the one who cherishes it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and that reserve, when it comes, comes altogether
too late for purposes of safeguarding.</p>

<p>But Dorothy did not care. She wanted these
two to love each other, and she saw no reason
why they should not. She recognised their
peculiar fitness for each other’s love, and as for
the rest&mdash;wise woman that she was&mdash;she trusted
love to overcome all difficulties. In other words,
Dorothy was a woman, and she herself had loved
and mated as God meant that women should.
So she was disposed to let well alone in this
case.</p>

<p>Kilgariff’s wound was healing satisfactorily
now, and little by little his strength was coming
back to him. So, every day, he sat in the
laboratory with Dorothy and Evelyn, helping in
the work by advice and suggestion, and often in
more direct and active ways. For Arthur Brent
had written to Dorothy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I must remain with the army yet a while in order
to keep the hospital service in as efficient a state as
adverse circumstances will permit, and the constant
shiftings from one place to another render this difficult.
When Kilgariff grows strong enough, set him at
work in the laboratory. He would never tell you so,
but he is a better chemist than I am, better even than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you in some respects. Especially he is expert in
shortening processes, and the army’s pressing need of
medicines renders this a peculiarly valuable art just
now. We need everything at every hour, but especially
we need opium and its products, and quinine or
quinine substitutes. Please give your own special attention
to your poppy fields, and get all you can of
opium from them. Send to Richmond all the product
except so much as you can use in the laboratory in
extracting the still more valuable alkaloids.</p>

<p class="pbq">Another thing: the dogwood-root bark bitters you
are sending prove to be a valuable substitute for
quinine. Please multiply your product if you can.
Enlist the services of your friends everywhere in supplying
you with the raw material. Get them to set
their little negroes at work digging and drying the
roots, so that you may make as much of the bitters as
possible. There are a good many wild cherry trees at
Wyanoke and on other plantations round about.
Won’t you experiment, with Kilgariff’s assistance, and
see if you can’t produce some quinine? Our need of
that is simply terrible. Malaria kills five times as
many men as Federal bullets do, and, apart from that,
hundreds of sick or wounded men could be returned
to duty a month earlier than they now are if we had
quinine enough. Tell Kilgariff I invoke his aid, and
you’ll get it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Kilgariff responded enthusiastically to this
appeal. He personally investigated the quinine-producing
capacity of every tree and plant that
grew at Wyanoke or in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“The dog fennel,” he said to Dorothy, “is
most promising. It yields quinine in greater
quantity, in proportion to the time and labour
involved, than anything else we have. Of course,
if ours were a commercial enterprise, it would
not pay to attempt any of these manufactures.
But our problem is simply to produce medicines
for the army at whatever cost. So I have taken
the liberty of ordering all your chaps”&mdash;the
term “chaps” in Virginia meant juvenile negroes&mdash;“to
gather all the dog fennel they can,
and to dry it on fence-rail platforms. I am having
the men put up some kettles in which to
steep it. The rest we must do in the laboratory.
Our great lack is that of kettles enough.”</p>

<p>“Must they be of iron?” asked Evelyn, with
earnest interest. “Must they have fires under
them?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” answered Kilgariff, hesitatingly. “I
suppose washtubs or anything that will hold
water will do. We must use hot water to steep
the plants in, but we might pour hot water into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
vessels in which we couldn’t heat it. Yes,
Evelyn, any sort of vessel that will hold water
will answer our purpose.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll provide all the tanks you need, if
Dorothy will give me leave to command the
servant-men. I do know how.”</p>

<p>The leave was promptly given, and Evelyn
instructed the negroes how to make staves of
large proportions, and how to put them together.
Three days later, with an adequate
supply of these, and with a quantity of binding
hoops which she had herself fashioned out of
hickory saplings to the utter astonishment of
her comrades, the girl manufactured a number
of wooden and water-tight tanks, each capable
of holding many scores of gallons.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn to do that?” Kilgariff
asked, when the first of the tanks was set up.</p>

<p>“Among the whale fishermen,” she answered.
“But I mustn’t tell you about that, and you
mustn’t ask. But my tanks will hold oil as
well as water, and I am going to make a little
one for castor oil. You know we have five
acres in castor beans. I reckon you two do
know how to make castor oil out of them.”</p>

<p>“Come here, Evelyn, and sit down,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Dorothy. “Of course we know how to extract
castor oil from the beans, but we don’t know
where or how you got your peculiar English.
Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand. Is my English not
like your own?”</p>

<p>“In some respects, no. When you volunteered
to make these tanks for us, you said, ‘I
do know how,’ and now you say, ‘You do know.’
We should say, ‘I know,’ and ‘You know.’
Where did you get your peculiar usage?”</p>

<p>The girl flushed crimson. Presently she
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is that I have not been taught. Pardon
me. I am trying to learn. I do listen&mdash;no, I
should say&mdash;I listen to your speech, and I try
to speak the same. I have read books and
tried to learn from them what the right speech
is. Am I not learning better now? I try, or I
am trying&mdash;which is it? And the big book&mdash;the
dictionary&mdash;I am studying. I never saw a
dictionary until I came to Wyanoke.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Kilgariff, tenderly. “You
speak quite well enough to make us glad to listen.”</p>

<p>And indeed they were glad to listen. For
now that the girl had become actively busy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the laboratory, she had lost much of her shy
reserve, and her conversation was full of inspiration
and suggestiveness. It was obvious that
while her instruction had been meagre and exceedingly
irregular, she had done a world of
thinking from such premises as were hers, and
the thinking had been sound.</p>

<p>Her ways were sweet and winning, chiefly
because of their utter sincerity, and they fascinated
both Dorothy and Kilgariff.</p>

<p>“Kilgariff must marry her,” Dorothy wrote
to Arthur Brent. “God evidently intended
that, when he made these two; but how it is to
come about, I do not at all know. Kilgariff
has some foolish notions that stand in the way,
but of course love will overcome them. As for
Evelyn&mdash;well, she is a woman, and that is
quite enough.”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s use of the intensives, ‘do’ and
‘did’ and the like, was not at all uniform.
Often she would converse for half an hour without
a lapse into that or any other of her peculiarities
of speech. It was usually excitement
or embarrassment or enthusiasm that brought
on what Dorothy called “an attack of dialect,”
and Kilgariff one day said to Dorothy:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“The girl’s speech ‘bewrayeth her,’ as Peter’s
did in the Bible.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, it is easy and perfectly safe to infer
from her speech a good deal of her life-history.”</p>

<p>“Go on, I am interested.”</p>

<p>“Well, you observe that she has almost a
phenomenal gift of unconscious imitation. She
has been with you for only a very brief while,
yet in the main her pronunciation, her inflection,
and even her choice of words are those of
a young woman brought up in Virginia. She
says ‘gyarden,’ ‘cyart,’ and the like, and her
<i>a</i>’s are quite as broad as your own when she
talks of the grass or the basket. Now when
she lapses into her own dialect, there is a
distinctively French note in her syntax, from
which I argue that she has lived among French-speaking
people for a time, catching their construction.
But, on the other hand, her English
is so good that I cannot think her life has been
mainly passed among French-speaking people.
Have you tried her in French itself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she speaks the most extraordinary
French I ever heard.”</p>

<p>“Well, that fits in with the other facts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
This morning she spoke of a hashed meat at
breakfast as ‘pemmican,’ though she quickly corrected
herself; she often uses Indian terms, too,
by inadvertence. Then again, her accomplishments
all smell of the woods. Putting all things
together, I should say that she has spent a good
deal of time among, or at least in frequent contact
with, Canadian Frenchmen and Indians.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said Dorothy, “and
yet some part of her life has been passed in
company with a well-bred and accomplished
woman.”</p>

<p>“Your body of facts, please?” said Kilgariff.</p>

<p>“Her speech, for one thing; for in spite of
its oddities it is mainly the speech of a cultivated
woman. She never uses slang; indeed,
I’m sure she knows no slang. Her constructions,
though often odd, are always grammatical,
and her diction is that of educated people.
Then again, her scrupulous attention to personal
neatness tells me much. More important
still, at least in my woman’s eyes, is the fact
that she perfectly knows how to make a bed
and how to make the most of the little ornaments
and fripperies of a room. She did not
learn these things from squaws or half-breeds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Moreover, she does needlework of an exquisite
delicacy which I never saw matched anywhere.
That tells of a highly bred woman as an influence
in her life and education.”</p>

<p>While these three were at dinner that day,
the negro head-man&mdash;for even in his enforced
absence Arthur Brent would not commit his authority
over his negroes to the brutal instincts
of any overseer&mdash;came to the door and asked
to speak with “Mis’ Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Bring me a decanter and a glass, Elsie,” said
Dorothy to the chief serving-maid. She poured
a dram into the glass, and handed it to the girl.</p>

<p>“Take that out to Uncle Joe,” she said, “and
tell him to come in after he has drunk it.”</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of the plantation negro in
Virginia that he never refused a dram from “the
gre’t house,” and yet that he never drank to
excess. Those negroes that served about the
house in one capacity or another were always
supplied with money&mdash;the proceeds of “tips”&mdash;and
could have bought liquor at will. Yet
none of them ever formed the drink habit.</p>

<p>When Uncle Joe came into the dining-room,
he had a number of matters concerning which
he desired instruction. When these affairs had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
been disposed of, and Dorothy had directed him
to slaughter a shoat on the following morning,
the mistress asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“How about the young mare, Uncle Joe?
Are you ever going to have her broken?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Missus, Dick’s de only pusson
on de plantation what dars to tackle dat dar
mar’, an’ Dick he’s done gone off to de wah wid
Mahstah. ‘Sides dat, de mar’ she done trowed
Dick hisse’f tree times. Dey simply ain’t no
doin’ nuffin’ wid dat dar mar’, Missus. I reckon
de only ting to do wid her is to sell her to de
artillery, whah dey don’ ax no odds o’ no hoss
whatsomever. She’s five year ole, an’ as strong
as two mules, an’ nobody ain’t never been able
to break her yit.”</p>

<p>“Poor creature!” said Evelyn. “May I try
what I can do with her, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“You, little Missus?” broke in Joe. “<i>You</i>
try to tackle de iron-gray mar’? Why, she’d
mash you like a potato wid her foh-feet, an’ den
turn roun’ an’ kick you to kingdom come wid de
hind par.”</p>

<p>“May I try, Dorothy?” the girl calmly asked
again, quite ignoring Uncle Joe’s prophecies of
evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better let some of the men or
boys break her first?”</p>

<p>“No. To me it is plain they have done too
much of that already. Let me have her as she
is. Have her brought up to the house, Uncle
Joe, soon after dinner, with nothing on her but
a halter.”</p>

<p>“Why, little Mis’, you don’ know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do precisely as I tell you,” interrupted the
girl, who could be very imperious when so
minded.</p>

<p>When the mare was brought, she was striking
viciously at the negro who led her. With ears
laid back close to her head, and with the whites
of her eyes showing menacingly, she was striking
out with her hoofs as if intent upon committing
homicide without further delay.</p>

<p>“Turn her loose, Ben,” said the girl, who sat
idly in the porch as if she had no task on her
hands. “Then go away from her, and make
all the rest go away, too&mdash;” motioning toward
the gang of little negroes who had assembled,
“to see de iron-gray mar’ kill little Missie.”</p>

<p>When all were gone, Evelyn began nibbling
at a sugar lump. Presently, after the mare had
discovered that she was quite free and that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tormentors were gone, Evelyn held out her hand
with the sugar lump in its palm. The animal
was obviously unfamiliar with sugar lumps, but
she had the curiosity which is commonly&mdash;perhaps
erroneously&mdash;attributed to her sex. So,
as Evelyn sat on the bench and made no motion
indicative of any purpose to seize the halter, the
animal presently became interested in the extended
hand. Little by little, and with occasional
snortings and recessions, she approached
the girl. Finally, finding that the extended
hand was not moved, she nosed the sugar lump,
and then with her long, flexible tongue, swept
it into her mouth.</p>

<p>Evelyn did not withdraw the hand at once,
but held it extended till the mare had got the
full flavour of the sweet. Meanwhile, she cooed
to the animal soothingly, and, after a little, she
produced a second sugar lump and laid it upon
the extended palm. This time, as the mare
took the dainty, Evelyn, still talking soothingly,
ventured with her other hand to stroke the
beast’s silky nose, caressingly. There was a
shrinking back on the part of the timid creature,
but the lure of the sugar was enticing, and after
once the gentle hand had stroked the mare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
face, she seemed rather to welcome than to
resent the caress.</p>

<p>Thus, little by little, did the girl establish relations
of amity between herself and the spirited
mare. After a while, Evelyn quitted her seat,
went out upon the lawn, and with a sugar-lump
bribe tempted the animal to approach her.
Then she stroked its head and neck and sides,
gradually giving it to understand that she meant
no harm and accustoming it to the pleasant
touch of her hands. Finally she stroked its legs
vigorously, and lifted one foot after another,
examining each.</p>

<p>By this time the mare seemed to have concluded
that the young woman, who talked ceaselessly
in her cooing, contralto voice, was an
altogether pleasant acquaintance. Wherever
the girl went, around the grounds, the mare
followed, nosing her and seemingly soliciting
her attention.</p>

<p>At last the girl tolled the mare to a horse
block, and for a time stood upon it, gently
stroking her silky back.</p>

<p>Then she made a motion as if to sit upon that
shapely back. The mare shied away, perhaps
remembering former attempts of the kind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
she had resented as indignities. But as Evelyn
did not insist upon her apparent purpose, and as
the mare was by this time very much in sympathy,
if not in love, with the gentle girl, she presently
sidled back into position, and Evelyn
seated herself upon her back, at the same time
caressingly stroking the sides of her neck. She
had neither saddle on which to sit securely, nor
bridle with which to control her mount, but there
was no need of either. The mare was nibbling
grass by this time, and Evelyn permitted her to
do so, letting her wander about the house grounds
at will, in search of the most succulent tufts.
As the supper hour drew near, the girl slipped
from the animal’s back and led the way, the
animal following, to the stables. There, with
her own hands she filled the manger and the hay-rack,
and after an affectionate farewell to her
new friend, returned to the house. But first she
said to Ben, the hostler:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let nobody feed the mare but me. I will
be at the stables in time in the morning. And
let nobody touch her with a currycomb. I will
myself attend to all.”</p>

<p>Three or four days later the high-spirited mare
was Evelyn Byrd’s very humble servant indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The girl rode her everywhere, teaching her a
number of pretty tricks, the most astonishing of
which was the art of lifting a gate latch with
her teeth, and letting herself and her rider
through the many barriers that Virginian law
accommodatingly permitted planters to erect
across the public roads.</p>

<p>“But how did you learn all this?” asked Kilgariff,
full of interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know. I reckon I never learned
it at all. You see, the animals fight us only because
they think we mean to fight them. So
long as they are afraid of us, they fight, of
course. When they learn that we are friendly,
they are glad to be friends. Anybody can tame
any animal if he goes to work in the right way.
I once tamed a Canada lynx, and it became so
used to me that I let it sleep on the foot of my
bed. But the lynx has a great deal of sense
and very little affection, while a horse has a
great deal of affection and very little sense.
With the lynx, I appealed to its good sense,
but I did never&mdash;I mean, I never trusted its
affection.</p>

<p>“I have treated this mare like a baby that does
not understand much, but I have won its affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
completely, and I trust that. The animal
has so little sense that it would scare at a
scrap of paper lying in the road, and go almost
frantic if it saw a man pulling a buggy. But
if I were on its back, it would not run or do
anything that might throw me off. You see,
one must know which is stronger in each animal&mdash;sense
or sentiment. With a horse it is
sentiment, so I curry the mare myself, talking
to her all the while in a loving way, and I
never let anybody else go into the stall. Another
thing: a horse loves liberty better than
anything else, so I have taken off the halter
with which the mare used to be tied in her
stall, and, as you know, I turn her loose every
morning when she has finished her fodder, and
she follows me up here to the house grounds
where she is perfectly free to nibble grass.
But she loves me so much that she often quits
the grass and comes up here to the porch just
to get me to rub her nose or stroke her neck.
She is strong, and I am light, so she likes me to
sit upon her back, as you have seen me do for
an hour at a time. She doesn’t quite like a
saddle yet&mdash;and neither do I. I would never
use anything more than a blanket, just for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
protection of my clothes, only that Dorothy
thinks that people would wonder, if I should go
visiting or to church riding bareback. Why do
people wonder in that way, Mr. Kilgariff, about
other people’s doings?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t know, unless it is
that we are all like the Pharisee in the parable,
and want to emphasise our own superiority by
criticising others.”</p>

<p>“But why shouldn’t the others criticise, too?
The ways of the people they criticise are no
more different from their ways, than their ways
are different from those of the people they criticise.
I confess I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I, Evelyn, except that it is the
habit of people to set up their own ways as a
standard and model, and to regard every departure
from them as a barbarism. If it were not
an accepted fact that the Venus of Milo is the
most perfect exemplification we have of feminine
beauty, and that it is the fashion to go into raptures
over that piece of sculpture, I imagine
that nine fashionable women in every ten would
ridicule the way in which her hair is done up,
simply because they do not do up theirs in the
same way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” answered the girl, dreamily,
and as if in a reverie. “That was the trouble
in the circus.”</p>

<p>“In the circus? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Don’t ask me.”</p>

<p class="pch">THE GREAT WAR GAME</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">ALL this while the war was going on
tremendously and Kilgariff was chafing
at the restraint of a wound which
forbade him to bear his part in it.</p>

<p>As we have seen, General Grant had crossed
into the Wilderness with a double strategic purpose.
He had hoped to turn Lee’s right flank
and compel the surrender of the Army of Northern
Virginia. Failing in that, he had hoped,
with his enormously superior numbers, to crush
and destroy Lee’s army in battle.</p>

<p>He had failed in that purpose also. By his
promptitude and vigour in assailing Grant’s
army in flank, Lee had compelled his adversary
to abandon his flanking purpose, and to withdraw
his advance columns over a distance of
more than ten miles in order to reinforce his
sorely beset divisions in the Wilderness and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
save his own army from the destruction he had
hoped to inflict upon his adversary.</p>

<p>After suffering a far heavier loss than he
inflicted, Grant had summoned reinforcements
and moved by his left flank to Spottsylvania
Court House. By this movement he had again
hoped to turn Lee’s right flank, place himself
between the Confederates and their capital, and
in that way compel the surrender or dispersal
of the Army of Northern Virginia. Again he
had been foiled by Lee’s alertness and by the
marvellous mobility of an army that moved
without a baggage-train, and whose men carried
no blankets, no extra clothing, no overcoats, no
canteens, no tin cups, no cooking-utensils&mdash;nothing,
in fact, except their rifles and their
ammunition.</p>

<p>Those men were on the verge of starvation
all the while. Often they had no rations at
all for two days or more at a time. When rations
were fullest, they consisted of one, two, or
three hard-tack biscuits a day for each man,
and perhaps a diminutive slice of salt pork or
bacon, which was eaten raw.</p>

<p>But these men, who had formerly fought with
the courage of hope, inspired by splendid victory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
were fighting now with the courage of
utter despair. A great wave of religious fervour
had passed over the army and the South. It
took upon itself the fatalistic forms of Calvinism,
for the most part. The men of the army
came to believe that every event which occurs
in this world was foreordained of God to occur,
decreed “before ever the foundations of the
world were laid.” They had not ceased to trust
the genius and sagacity of Lee, but they had
accepted the rule and guidance of a greater than
Lee&mdash;of God Almighty himself. With a faith
that was sublime even in its perversion, these
men committed themselves and their cause to
God, and ceased to reckon upon human probabilities
as factors in the problem.</p>

<p>There were prayer meetings in every tent and
at every bivouac fire, every day and every night.
At every pause in the fighting, were it only for
a few minutes, the men on the firing-line threw
themselves upon their knees and besought God
to crown their efforts and their arms with victory,
submissively leaving it to Him to determine
the where, the when, the how. And in
this worship of God and this absolute dependence
upon His will the men of that army learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to regard themselves personally as mere pawns
upon the chess-board of the divine purpose.
They came to regard their own lives as dust in
the balance, to be blown away by the breath of
God’s will, to be sacrificed, as fuel is, for the
maintenance of a flame.</p>

<p>Believing firmly and without question that
their cause was in God’s charge, they executed
every order given to them with an indifference
to personal consequences for the like of which
one may search history in vain.</p>

<p>In his movement from the Wilderness to
Spottsylvania, General Grant again failed to
turn the flank of his wily adversary, and, after
a prolonged endeavour to break and destroy
Lee’s army there, the Federal commander again
moved by his left flank, in the hope of reaching
Hanover Court House in advance of the arrival
there of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>Again he was baffled of his purpose. Again
Lee got there first, and took up a position in
which, by reason of the river’s tortuous course
and the conformation of the ground, Grant could
not assail him without dividing his own army
into three parts, no one of which could be depended
upon to support either of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>At one point the Federal general very nearly
succeeded. There was a bridge across the
stream near Hanover Court House. If that
could be seized, the Federal forces might cross
and assail Lee’s left flank with effect. A strong
column of Federals was thrown forward to possess
the bridge, and for a time it looked as if
they would succeed and bring the war to an
end right there.</p>

<p>But two Confederate batteries&mdash;utterly unsupported&mdash;were
thrown forward. One was
Captain Pollard’s; the other was a battery from
the battalion of Major Baillie Pegram. Advancing
at a full run, the two batteries planted
their guns at the head of the bridge, just as the
Federal columns were beginning to cross it, and
within five minutes the bridge had ceased to be.</p>

<p>Has the reader ever seen Shepard’s spirited
painting called “Virginia, 1864”? The sketch
from which that painting was made was drawn
on this hotly contested field, the artist having
three pencils carried away from his grasp by
rifle bullets and half a dozen rents made in his
drawing-paper while he worked.</p>

<p>Thus, for the third time baffled in his effort
to place his army between Lee and Richmond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Grant moved again by his left flank to the
neighbourhood of Cold Harbour, where one of
the severest battles of the seven days’ fight
between Lee and McClellan had been waged.</p>

<p>Again Lee discovered his purpose, and again
he got there first. He seized upon a line of
hills and hastily fortified them. He was now
in front of Richmond and only a few miles in
advance of that city’s defences. He thought
it not imprudent, therefore, to call to his assistance
such troops as were engaged in garrisoning
the works about Richmond; thus for the
first time in all that strenuous campaign having
an opportunity in some small degree to make
good the waste of war, by way of preparing himself
to meet an enemy who had been reinforced
almost daily since the beginning of the campaign,
and whose army at that time outnumbered the
Confederate force by more than three to one.</p>

<p>At Lee’s back lay the now bridgeless Chickahominy&mdash;an
erratic stream which might at any
moment cut him off from all possibility of retreat.
If Grant could defeat him where he lay,
or even seriously cripple him, the pathway of
the Army of the Potomac into Richmond would
be scarcely at all obstructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>In hope of this result, Grant determined upon
an assault in force. In the gray of the morning
of June 3, he assailed Lee with all of impetuosity
and all of force that an army of
one hundred and fifty thousand men could
bring to bear against an army of less than fifty
thousand.</p>

<p>The result was disastrous in the extreme
to the Federals. They marched into a very
slaughter pen, where they lost about ten thousand
men within twenty minutes, for the reason
that Lee had previously discovered their purpose
and had prepared himself to receive their
onslaught with all the enginery of slaughter.</p>

<p>In effect, this disaster to the Federal arms
ended the field campaign of 1864. It had been
four times demonstrated that in strategy Lee
was more than a match for his adversary. It
had been four times demonstrated that in field
fighting the little Army of Northern Virginia
could not be overcome by the force, three times
as great, which Grant had so often and so determinedly
hurled against it.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to the Federal commander
except to besiege Richmond, either
directly on the north and east, or indirectly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
way of Petersburg, twenty-two miles south and
commanding the main lines of Confederate military
communication.</p>

<p>Butler already lay on the south side of the
James River with a strong detachment and
within easy striking distance of Petersburg, a
city defended by an exceedingly inadequate
force under Beauregard. Grant ordered Butler
to seize upon Petersburg quickly, before the
place could be defended. If that plan had been
successful, Richmond must have surrendered or
been evacuated, and the war must have ended
in the early summer of 1864, instead of dragging
its slow length along for nearly a year
more. But Beauregard’s extraordinary alertness
and vigour baffled Butler’s purpose. In
spite of the exceeding meagreness of the Confederate
defending force, before Grant could
push the head of his column into Petersburg,
Lee was there; and within a few hours the
Army of Northern Virginia, equally skilled in
the use of bayonet and spade, had created that
slender line of earthworks behind which Lee’s
thin and constantly diminishing force defended
itself for two thirds of a year to come.</p>

<p class="pch">THE LAW OF LOVE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">“MRS. BRENT&mdash;” Kilgariff so began
a sentence one morning.</p>

<p>But Dorothy interrupted him,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Why do you persist in addressing me in
that way?” she asked. “Are we not yet sufficiently
friends for you to call me ‘Dorothy,’ as
all my intimates do? You know, I exacted that
of Evelyn in the first moment that I found myself
fond of her and knew that she loved me.”</p>

<p>“But there is a difference,” answered Kilgariff.
“You see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a difference, but it is altogether
on the side of my contention. Evelyn is much
younger than I am; for although, as you know,
I am still only twenty-four, Evelyn has the advantage
of several years of age. She <i>thinks</i>
she is only seventeen, but as nearly as I can
figure out from what she tells me she must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
approaching nineteen. However that may be,
you, at any rate, are nearly as old as Arthur.
You and he have been intimates all your lives,
and if that intimacy is well-founded, I see no
reason why you should not include me in it, so
far at least, as to call me by my Christian name.
You see, I was ‘Dorothy’ long before I became
‘Mrs. Brent,’ and my given name has many
pleasing associations in my ears. My father
always called me that. So did my mother, after
I came to know her. Arthur did so, too, after I
learned to like him and gave him leave. Of
course, to all outsiders I am ‘Mrs. Brent’&mdash;a
name that I am proud and glad to bear, because&mdash;well,
because of Arthur. But to the insiders&mdash;to
my friends&mdash;I have a strong inclination
to be just ‘Dorothy.’ Don’t you think you
have become an insider?”</p>

<p>Kilgariff hesitated for a time before answering.
Finally he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is very gracious of you&mdash;all this. But I
wonder how much Arthur has told you about
me?”</p>

<p>“He has told me everything he knows,” she
answered, with an added touch of dignity. “We
should not be man and wife if either were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
capable of practising reserve with the other in
such a case as this.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” responded Kilgariff. “I
do not like sailing under false colours; but, as
you know all, why, it will be a special pleasure
to me to be permitted to call you ‘Dorothy.’”</p>

<p>“Now, what were you going to say when I
interrupted you?” asked Dorothy, the direct.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I forget.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, or at least you can remember
in such a case. So think a bit, Owen, and
tell me what you were going to say. It was
something about Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>“Why, for several reasons. For one thing,
you caught sight of Evelyn just at that moment,
as she was teaching her mare to kneel down for
her to mount. You heard her voice, too, as
she chided the mare in half playful fashion for
rising too abruptly after the mount. A woman’s
voice means much to a man of sensitive nature.
She talks in just that way to the children&mdash;my
babies&mdash;and their liking for it is positively
wonderful. Only this morning Mammy and I
were having all sorts of trouble to get them out
of their bath. Bob, the boy, was bent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
spending the rest of the day in the tub, and was
disposed to raise a rumpus over every effort to
lift him out, and Mildred, girl-like, took her cue
from her ‘big brother.’ In the midst of the
turmoil Evelyn came in. She assumed a look
of astonishment, which attracted Bob’s attention
and for the moment quieted him. Then
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Bob! I m sorry you’re bad. But
you are. You’re very bad indeed, so I mustn’t
tell you about the ten little Injuns. You’re
getting to be bad just like them.’</p>

<p>“By that time she had lifted the boy out of
the tub and dried him and slipped a garment
upon him, he not protesting in the least. Then
she stood him up in her lap, and, looking at him
in seeming surprise, she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Why, Bob isn’t bad a bit! Evey made a
great big mistake. Evey’s going to tell Bob
about the ten little Injun boys.’ And from
that moment there was no disturbance in the
nursery except the noise of joyous laughter.</p>

<p>“I said to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘You deal with them just as if they were
wild animals to be tamed.’</p>

<p>“She answered:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘So they are, only people often forget it,
cruelly.’”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Kilgariff, “let me have
your other reason, or reasons, for thinking that
what I set out to say had some reference to
Evelyn. I plead guilty to your charge that I
caught sight of Evelyn teaching the mare, and
that I was charmed by the sweetness and sympathetic
jollity of her voice, as she addressed
the animal in her winning way. But you were
going to offer another fact in support of your
assumption. What was it?”</p>

<p>“Why, simply that you hadn’t spoken for
ten minutes before you addressed me. You
were meditating, and whenever you meditate
nowadays, you are thinking of Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. You are not always aware of
the fact, but the fact is always there. I like it
to be always there.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“Why, because I want you to be that way
with Evelyn. It will mean happiness in the
future for both of you.”</p>

<p>“No; it will mean at best a gently mitigated
unhappiness to me&mdash;and I shall be glad of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gentle mitigation. To her it will mean nothing
more than a pleasant friendship. I do not
intend that it ever shall mean more than that
to her.”</p>

<p>“But why not? Why should it not mean
everything to her that womanhood longs for?
Why should you not win Evelyn’s love and
make her your wife? I never knew two people
better fitted to make each other happy, and
fortunately you have possessions in Europe and
at the North which will enable you to take a
wife, no matter how disastrously this war may
end for us of the South. Believe me, Owen,
in creating men and women, God intended marriage
and happiness in marriage for the common
lot of humanity. He does not give it to
all of us to be great, or to achieve great things,
or to render great services, but, if we hearken
to His voice as it whispers within us, He intends
happiness for us, and His way of giving
happiness is in marriage, prompted by love.
We poor mortals interfere with Nature’s plan
in many ways. Especially we sin by ‘match-making’&mdash;by
bringing about marriages without
love and for the sake of convenience of one
kind or another. We wed bonds to city lots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
We trade girls for titles, giving a money boot.
We profane the holiest of human relations in
order to join one plantation to another, or to
unite two distinguished houses, or for some
other equally devilish reason.</p>

<p>“It is the best thing about this war that its
tendency is to obliterate artificialities and restore
men and women to natural conditions&mdash;at
least here at the South. Believe me, Owen,
the union of a man and a woman who really
love each other, is the crowning fact of all
existence. You and I are somewhat skilled in
science. We know the truth that Nature is
illimitably attentive not only to the preservation
of the race, but to its improvement also; and
we know that Nature takes no care whatever
of the individual, but ruthlessly sacrifices him
for the sake of the race. Nature is right, and
we are criminally wrong when we thwart her
purposes, as we do when we make marriages
that have no love for their inspiration, or in any
way bar marriage where love prompts it. I am
old-fashioned, I suppose, but old fashions are
sometimes good fashions. They are always so
when they are the outgrowths of natural conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now put all that aside. I have had my
little say. Let me hear what it was that you
were going to say to me concerning Evelyn. I
recognise your right, as you do not, to criticise
in that quarter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had no thought of criticising,” answered
Kilgariff. “On the contrary, I am disposed
to think you and I have made a valuable
discovery in pedagogics.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, that the best way to teach science is
backward.”</p>

<p>“I confess I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, look at the thing. If Evelyn had
been sent to a scientific school to study chemistry,
her professor would have set her to studying
a book of general principles. Then, after
three or four months of drudgery, she would
have been permitted to perform a few experiments
in the laboratory, by way of illustrating
and verifying what the book had told her, the
greater part of which she had known before
she began. You and I have begun at the
other end. We have set Evelyn to do practical
work in the laboratory. I remember that her
first task was to wash opium, and her next to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
manufacture blue mass out of rose petals and
mercury. Incidentally we explained to her the
general principles involved, and in that purely
incidental way she has learned her general
chemistry so thoroughly within a few weeks,
and without opening a book, that she could pass
any examination upon it that any college professor
could put up. She has learned more
in a month than any systematic class work would
have taught her in a year.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right,” answered Dorothy.
“But that is the only way I know. It is
the way in which Arthur taught me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should suppose that Arthur is distinctly
a man of original genius. He <i>knows
how to get things done</i>. He is so immeasurably
the superior of all the professors I ever knew
that I am disposed to name none of them in
comparison with him. If it is ever my lot to
undertake the teaching of science, I shall adopt
precisely that method. And I do not see why
the same principle should not be applied to
other departments of learning. We begin at
the wrong end. The teacher makes the boy
begin where he himself did. I think Arthur’s
methods immeasurably better, and I spoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Evelyn’s case only as an illustration of their
superiority. That young woman knows much&mdash;very
much&mdash;of science without having had
any formal instruction in it at all. She has
learned it in the natural way, and she is deeply
imbued with the scientific spirit. Only yesterday
she said to me, in answer to some question
of mine, that she ‘looked straight at things, and
thought about them.’ I cannot imagine a more
perfect method than that.</p>

<p>“And what book ever taught her what she
knows about animals and their ways? What
lecturer in all the world could have told her
how to subdue that wild and rebellious mare
as she has done? She learned all that simply
by ‘looking straight at things and thinking
about them.’ The professional horse-tamers&mdash;Rarey
and the rest&mdash;set to work, with their
mechanical appliances, to convince a horse that
they are mightier than he is. They succeed
in a way. They make the horse afraid of
them, and so long as they deal with him, he
submits, in fear of their superior power. But
let a timid novice undertake to ride horses thus
broken, or to drive them, and disaster comes.
Evelyn’s way is incalculably better and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
scientific. She has studied animals and learned
to understand them and sympathise with them.
She makes her appeal to what is best in their natures,
not to what is worst, and she gets results
that no horse-tamer of them all could ever hope
for. The horse-tamer’s processes belong to the
domain of artifice. Hers are purely scientific.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” answered Dorothy; “and I
often wonder where she learned it all, or rather
where she got her inspiration, for it is not so
much learning as a natural bent.”</p>

<p>“Well, she was born with an instinct of
truthfulness for one thing,” said Kilgariff.
“That is the only basis of the scientific temperament.
I observed her yesterday trying to
tempt a fox squirrel out of one of the trees.
She chirped to him in her peculiar fashion, and,
in response to her invitation, he would run down
as far as the root of the tree; but there he would
pause and shrewdly reconnoitre, after which he
would run back up the tree.</p>

<p>“‘Why don’t you hold out your hand?’ I
asked.</p>

<p>“She quickly answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘That would be lying to him. Whenever I
hold out my hand to him, I have something in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it for him to eat. If I held it out empty, I
should be saying there was something for him
to eat in it, and that would be a lie. He would
come to me then and find out that I had deceived
him. You do quit believing&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;you quit believing&mdash;anybody that tells
you lies.’</p>

<p>“I admitted my propensity to distrust untruthful
persons, and she gravely asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Why then do you wish me to deceive the
poor little squirrel? Do you want him to think
me a person not to be trusted?’</p>

<p>“I made some lame excuse about his being
only a dumb animal, and she quickly responded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘But dumb animals are entitled to truthfulness,
are they not, particularly when we ask
them to confide in us? I should be ashamed of
you, Monsieur’&mdash;you know she always calls
me ‘Monsieur’ when she is displeased with me&mdash;‘if
I did not understand. The human people
do not know the animals&mdash;how trustful they
want to be if only we would let them. We set
traps for them, we deceive them in a hundred
ways, and that is why they distrust us. I did
read a few days ago&mdash;you smile, Monsieur;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
I should say, I read the other day&mdash;that
the wild creatures are selfish, that they care
for us only as a source of food supply. That
is not true, as that squirrel shall teach you. It
is true that all the wild creatures are <i>hungry all
the time</i>. There is not food enough for all of
them, and so when we offer them food, they
come to us, even in fear. They have many of
their young to feed, and their supplies are very
scant. That is why they congregate around
houses where there is waste thrown out. But
oh, Monsieur, many hundreds of them do starve
to death in the long winters. You notice that
in the spring there are a dozen robins on the
lawn; in the early summer, when they have
brought forth their broods, there are scores and
hundreds of them. But in the next spring there
are only the dozens again. The rest have perished
of cold and hunger. I have been reading
Mr. Darwin’s book, and I know that this is the
universal law of progress, of advancement by
the struggle for existence, and the survival of
the fittest under the law of heredity. But it is
very cruel. That isn’t what I wanted to say.
I wanted to show you that even the wild creatures&mdash;hungry
as they always are&mdash;have affection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I am going to make that squirrel come to me
and sit on my shoulder without giving him any
food as a temptation. You shall see. After
that, I will give him plenty to eat.’</p>

<p>“And she did. She wheedled the squirrel
till he came down his tree, crossed the lawn,
and invaded her lap. It was only then that
she gave him the peanuts with which she had
filled her pockets. I tell you that girl is a born
scientist, and that her knowledge is wonderful.
Did it ever occur to you that the squirrels and
birds that seem so happy here in the Wyanoke
grounds are habitually in a state of starvation?”</p>

<p>Just then Evelyn came walking toward the
porch. The mare was closely following her,
and a squirrel perched upon one shoulder,
while a robin clung to the other. She had
pockets in her gown&mdash;she insisted upon pockets&mdash;and
from these she fed the wild creatures.
Upon getting a nut, the squirrel leaped
to the ground, and upon receiving a bit of
bread, the robin flew away.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Kilgariff, “how coldly selfish
and calculating your wild creatures are. The
moment they get something to eat, they quit
your hospitality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so, Monsieur,” the girl answered.
“They have their babies to feed. They will
come back to me when that is done,” and
they did.</p>

<p>“Touch the squirrel,” she said to Kilgariff,
“and he will fasten his long teeth in your
flesh. But I may stroke his fur as much as I
please. That is because he has made friends
with me. And see! The robin is a wild bird.
His first instinct is to keep his wings free for
flying. Yet I may take him thus”&mdash;possessing
herself of the bird&mdash;“and lay him on his
back in my lap, so that his wings are useless
to him, and he does not mind. It is because
he knows me for his friend and trusts me.
Ah, if only people would learn to know the
wild creatures and teach them the lesson of
love!”</p>

<p>Kilgariff felt like saying, “I know no such
teacher of that lesson as you are,” but he refrained,
and so it fell to Dorothy afterward to
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Not many people have your gift, dear, of
making other creatures love them.”</p>

<p>“But you have it,” the girl answered enthusiastically.
“Oh, how I do love you, Dorothy!”</p>

<p class="pch">ORDERS AND “NO NONSENSE”</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN General Grant, with one hundred
and twenty thousand men, sat
down before Petersburg and Richmond
and called for reinforcements as a necessary
preliminary to further operations, his plan
was obvious, and its ultimate outcome was nearly
as certain as any human event can be before it
has happened.</p>

<p>Richmond lies on the north bank of the James
River. Petersburg lies on the Appomattox
River twenty-two miles due south of Richmond.
Each river is navigable up to the gates of the
city situated upon it, so that in besieging the
two cities from the east, General Grant had an
uninterrupted water communication over which
to bring supplies and reinforcements at will.
His line of fortifications stretched from a point
on the north of Richmond, eastwardly and southwardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to the James River, and thence southwardly,
with a westerly trend, to a point south of
Petersburg. A rude outline map, which accompanies
the text, will give a clearer understanding
than words can.</p>

<p>A glance at the map will show the reader
three lines of railway upon which Richmond
depended for communication with the South and
for supplies for Lee’s army. All of them lay
south of the James River.</p>

<p>Grant’s problem was to break these three lines
of railway, and thus to compel Richmond’s surrender
or evacuation. If he could break the
Weldon railway first, and the others later, as he
purposed, his vastly superior army at the time
of Richmond’s evacuation could be easily interposed
between Lee and any point farther south
to which the Confederate commander might plan
to retreat.</p>

<p>That is what actually happened eight months
later, with Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court
House as the outcome of this successful strategy.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Lee, with less than forty
thousand men, was called upon to defend a line
more than thirty miles long against an enemy
whose numbers were three or four times his own,
and whose capacity of reinforcement was almost
limitless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-169.jpg" width="400" height="626"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc">Sketch Map showing Lee’s and Grant’s lines about<br />
Richmond and Petersburg</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Still more important was the fact that Lee
must stand ready, by day and by night, to defend
every point on this long line, while his
adversary, with the assistance of ships and railroads
in his rear, could concentrate irresistible
forces at any point he pleased and at any time
he pleased, without the knowledge of the Confederate
commander. To the military on-looker
it appeared easy for Grant to break through
Lee’s lines whenever he pleased, by hurling an
overwhelming force with irresistible momentum
against any part of the attenuated thread that
he might elect, breaking through with certainty
and entire ease.</p>

<p>Such would have been the case but for the
splendid fighting quality of that Army of
Northern Virginia which was struggling almost
literally in its “last ditch.” Time after time
Grant massed his forces and threw them with
all his might against the weakest points he
could find in Lee’s defensive lines, only to be
baffled and beaten by a fighting force that
was absolutely unconquerable in its obstinate
determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>But Grant had other arrows in his well-stocked
quiver. His enormous superiority in numbers,
and his easy ability to manœuvre beyond his
adversary’s sight or ken, made it possible for
him continually to extend his lines to the left;
pushing south and west, and compelling Lee to
stretch out his already slender line to the point
of hopeless thinness.</p>

<p>Grant could one day assail the defences below
Richmond on the north side of the James
River in vastly superior force, and the next
morning at daybreak hurl five men to Lee’s one
against the works defending the Weldon Railroad,
thirty miles or more to the south.</p>

<p>Yet even under these conditions the brilliant
Confederate strategist not only held his own,
but detached from his all too meagre force a
strong column under Early, and sent it to sweep
the valley of Virginia, invade Maryland, and so
far threaten Washington as to compel Grant
either to send forces for the defence of the
Federal capital or to forego for the time being
the reinforcements which he was clamorously
demanding for the strengthening of his lines at
Petersburg.</p>

<p>Captain Marshall Pollard’s battery was included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in the detail of troops made for this
final and despairing invasion of the country
north of the Potomac; and when the battery
marched, Sergeant-major Owen Kilgariff rode
by the side of his captain, ready for any duty
that might fall to his lot.</p>

<p>The wound in his neck was not yet well, or
even nearly so, but he was quite regardless of
self in his eagerness to bear his part, and so, in
spite of all the warnings of all the doctors, he
had rejoined his command at the first moment
in which he was strong enough to sit upright in
the saddle.</p>

<p>Captain Pollard had but one commissioned
officer with him on this dare-devil expedition,
and that one officer was shot in the first skirmish,
so that Owen Kilgariff, non-commissioned
officer that he was, was second in command of
the battery.</p>

<p>Early’s column swept like a hurricane down
the valley, and like a cyclone burst upon Maryland
and Pennsylvania. It marched fearlessly
wherever it pleased and fought tremendously
wherever it encountered a foe. Its invasion of
the North at a time when Grant with three or
four men to Lee’s one was beleaguering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Southern capital, was romantic, gallant, picturesque,
startling. But it did not accomplish the
purpose intended. It was Grant’s conviction
that Washington City could take care of itself;
that the authorities there had force enough at
command, or within call, to meet and repel a
Confederate invasion, without any assistance
from him. He, first of all Federal generals,
acted upon this conviction, and refused to
weaken his lines at Petersburg and Richmond
by sending any considerable forces to defend
Washington against Early. Grant had little imagination,
but he had a great fund of common
sense.</p>

<p>Only one considerable action was the outcome
of this expedition. In a minor encounter on
the day before the battle was fought, Captain
Marshall Pollard lost a leg, thus leaving his
sergeant-major, Owen Kilgariff, in command
of the battery, reduced now to four guns, with
only four horses to each piece or caisson.</p>

<p>At Monocacy, Kilgariff fought the guns at
their best, and by a dash of a kind which artillery
is neither armed nor expected to make,
captured two Federal rifled guns, with their
full complement of horses. In his report he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
spoke of this feat of arms only as “an opportunity
which offered to add two guns to the
battery and to raise the tale of horses to the
regulation number of six to each gun and
caisson.”</p>

<p>But that night General Early sent for Kilgariff,
in response to that non-commissioned
officer’s request that a commissioned officer
should be sent to take command of the battery.</p>

<p>“I don’t see the necessity,” said Early, in his
abrupt way. “I don’t see how anybody could
fight his guns better than you have done. Get
yourself killed if you want somebody else to
command Pollard’s battery. So long as you
live, I shall send nobody else. How does it
happen that you haven’t a commission?”</p>

<p>“I do not covet that responsibility,” Kilgariff
answered evasively.</p>

<p>“Well, that responsibility will rest on your
shoulders from this hour forth, till the end of
this campaign, unless you escape it by getting
yourself killed. I shall certainly not send anybody
else to command your battery while you
live. From this hour I shall regard you as
Captain Kilgariff; and when I get myself into
communication with General Lee or the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
department, I’ll see that the title is made
good.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, General,” answered Kilgariff.
“But I sincerely wish you wouldn’t. I have
already received and rejected one commission
as captain, and I have declined a still higher
rank offered me.”</p>

<p>“What an idiot you must be!” squeaked
Early in his peculiar, falsetto voice. “But you
know how to fight your guns, and I’ve got a
use for such men as you are. You may do as
you please after this campaign is over, but while
you remain under my command you’ll be a captain.
I’ll see to that, and there’ll be no nonsense
about it, either.”</p>

<p>An hour later, an order, officially signed and
certified, came to Kilgariff. It read in this
wise:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><span class="smcap">Special Order No. 7.</span> Sergeant-major Owen Kilgariff,
of Captain Pollard’s Virginia Battery, is hereby
ordered to assume command of said Battery as Acting
Captain, and he will exercise the authority of that
rank in all respects. He is ordered hereafter to sign
his reports and orders as “Captain Commanding,”
and all officers concerned are hereby directed, by
order of the Commanding General, to recognise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rank thus conferred, not only in matters of ordinary
obedience to orders, but also in making details for
court-martial service and the like. This temporary
appointment of Captain Kilgariff is made in recognition
of peculiarly gallant and meritorious conduct, and
in due time it will be confirmed by the War Department.
In the meanwhile Captain Kilgariff’s rank,
commission, and authority are to be fully recognised
by all persons concerned, by virtue of this order.</p>

<p class="p1">This order was duly signed by General Early’s
adjutant-general, as by his command.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Kilgariff to do but
obey an order so peremptory, from a commander
who was not accustomed to brook opposition
with patience. Kilgariff’s first thought
was to send through the regular military channels
a written protest and declination. But an
insuperable difficulty stood in the way. Under
Early’s order, he must sign that document not
as “Sergeant-major,” but as “Captain.” Otherwise,
his act would be of that contumacious sort
which military law defines as “conduct subversive
of good order and military discipline.”</p>

<p>But aside from that consideration was the
fact that General Early had sent Kilgariff a
personal note, in which he had written:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">I have issued an order in your case. Obey it. I
don’t want any damned nonsense.</p>

<p class="p1">Kilgariff was too good a soldier to protest
further while the campaign under Early should
continue. He meant to ask excuse later, but
for the time being there was nothing for him to
do except assume the captain’s rank and command
to which Early had thus peremptorily
assigned him.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XII</h2>

<p class="pch">SAFE-CONDUCT OF TWO KINDS</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AS Early was slowly making his way
back into the valley of Virginia&mdash;fighting
wherever there was a force
to be fought&mdash;there came a messenger to
Owen Kilgariff one night a little before midnight.
He bore a slip of paper on which these
words were written:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Come to me quickly. I am mortally wounded, and
it is very necessary for me to see you before I die&mdash;not
for my sake, for you’d rejoice to see me in hell,
but for the sake of others and for your own sake&mdash;though
for yourself you don’t often care much. I’m
in a farm-house hospital three miles south of Harper’s
Ferry on the Martinsburg road. My messenger will
guide you. The Federals have possession, of course,
but the bearer of this note has a safe-conduct for you.
Of course, this might be a trick, but it is not. On the
word of a gambler (and you know what that means) I
am playing fair this time. You are a brave enough
man to risk this thing anyhow. Come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This note bore no signature, but Owen Kilgariff
knew the hand that had written it. That
handwriting had sent him to jail once upon a
time. He had not forgotten. He was not given
to forgetting.</p>

<p>He summoned the messenger who had
brought him the note.</p>

<p>“You have a safe-conduct for me, I believe?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Captain,” and he produced the document.</p>

<p>“How did you manage to pass our picket
lines? Did you come under a flag of truce?”</p>

<p>“No. That would have taken time, and there
is no time to be wasted. Major Campbell is
terribly wounded. I live in these parts. I ain’t
a soldier, you know. So I slipped through the
lines.”</p>

<p>For a moment Kilgariff regarded the fellow
with indignant contempt. Then the indignation
passed, and the contempt was intensified in his
expression. Presently he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You low-lived, contemptible hound, I can’t
make up my mind even to be angry with you.
You and your kind are the pest in this war. You
haven’t character enough to take sides. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
serve either side at will, and betray both with
jaunty indifference. Now listen to me. Within
twenty-four hours I shall see Major Campbell,
who sent me this note. But I shall not go to
him under the safe-conduct you have brought.”</p>

<p>With that, Kilgariff tore the paper to bits and
scattered its fragments to the night wind.</p>

<p>“I shall order you sent to the guard-house
and manacled, until General Early shall have
decided what to do with you. He doesn’t like
your sort.”</p>

<p>The man fell at once into panic and pleaded
for his life.</p>

<p>“Oh, what will become of me?” he piteously
moaned.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” answered Kilgariff,
quite as if the question had related to the disposition
to be made of some inanimate object.
“General Early may have you shot at sunrise,
or he may decide to hang you instead. I don’t
at all know, and after all it makes no real difference.
The one death is about as painless as
the other, and as for the matter of disgrace, of
course you are hopelessly incapable of considering
that. Perhaps&mdash;oh, well, I don’t know.
General Early may conclude to turn you loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as a creature too contemptible to be seriously
dealt with.”</p>

<p>“God grant that he may!” said the man,
with fervour, as the guards took him away.</p>

<p>A minute later Kilgariff mounted his horse,
Wyanoke&mdash;a special gift from Dorothy&mdash;and
rode hurriedly to General Early’s headquarters;
it was after midnight, but with this army sleeplessly
“on service” very little attention was
given to hours, either of the day or of the
night. So, after a moment’s parley with a sentinel,
Kilgariff was conducted to General Early’s
presence, under a tree.</p>

<p>It was not Kilgariff’s habit to grow excited.
He had passed through too much for that, he
thought. But on this occasion his perturbation
of spirit was so great that he had difficulty in
enunciating his words.</p>

<p>“General,” he said, “I want a little cavalry
force, if you please. I want to capture one of
the enemy’s hospitals and hold it long enough
for me to have a talk with the most infamous
scoundrel who ever lived.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Captain,” said Early. “Have
a little apple brandy as a tonic. Your nerves
are shaken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Kilgariff declined the stimulant, but at Early’s
earnest solicitation he sat down upon a stump,
and presently so far commanded his own spirit
as to go on with what he had to say.</p>

<p>“One of those contemptible border wretches
got himself smuggled through our lines to-night.
I don’t know how. He brought me a note
from the most infamous scoundrel I ever knew,
together with a safe-conduct under which I
could sneak into the enemy’s lines and talk
with the fellow, who is mortally wounded. I
tore up the safe-conduct and sent the emissary
to the guard-house with the comfortable assurance
that his case would be submitted to you,
and that you would pretty certainly order him
shot or hanged according to the gravity with
which you might regard his offence. I hope
you’ll let him go. He is so poor-spirited a cur
that he will suffer a thousand deaths to-night
in dreading one for to-morrow. However, that
isn’t what I want to speak with you about. I
want a cavalry force of a company or two.
I want to raid that hospital before morning
and talk with that rascal in the interest of
others whose fate he may hold in his hands.”</p>

<p>“Do you plan to kill him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not. He is wounded unto death.
And besides&mdash;well, General, he isn’t of our
class.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand&mdash;not a man you could
‘call out.’”</p>

<p>“Distinctly not&mdash;although he has a major’s
commission.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;if you want a colonel’s or a brigadier-general’s,
you shall have it,” broke in Early,
full of the enthusiasm of fight.</p>

<p>“No, General,” answered Kilgariff, with an
amused smile; “I have always found it possible
to fight anybody I pleased without raising the
question of rank. You know, a private, if he
is a man of good family, may slap a major-general’s
jaws in our army, in full certainty that
his escapade will bring a challenge rather than
a citation before a court-martial. No. I want to
talk with this man before he dies. He sent me
a safe-conduct, as I have already said. That
was a gracious permission from the Federal
authorities for me to see him. I have a very
pronounced prejudice against the acceptance of
gracious permissions from the Federal authorities.
So I have come to ask for a squadron of
cavalry, to which I will add a couple of guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in order that I may capture that post, enter its
hospital, and have my talk with its inmate without
anybody’s permission but yours, General.”</p>

<p>The humour of the situation appealed strongly
to Early, as it did also to Major Irby of the Virginia
Cavalry, who was sitting near by. That
officer was a man of few words, but he carried
an unusually alert sabre, and his sense of humour
was uncommonly keen.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, General,” he said, in his
quiet fashion, “I should like to ‘sit in’ the captain’s
game.”</p>

<p>“Do it!” said Early. “Take three companies
and two of Kilgariff’s guns, and let him
show the fellow that he carries his own safe-conduct
at his back.”</p>

<p>Things were done promptly and quickly in
those stirring times, and five minutes after
Early had spoken his words of permission,
Major Irby moved at the head of three companies
of cavalry and two of Kilgariff’s guns&mdash;the
two so recently captured from the enemy,
and selected now by way of emphasising the
jest.</p>

<p>A dash, a scurry, and every picket post south
of Harper’s Ferry was swept out of sight.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">KILGARIFF HEARS NEWS</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AS soon as Major Irby had possessed
himself of the hospital and the region
round about, he gave orders to throw
out pickets a mile or so in every direction, in
order to guard against surprise. He posted
Kilgariff’s guns on a little hill, where their fire
could sweep all of the roads over which an
advance of the enemy was possible. Then he
ordered the officer of the guard to post a strong
line of sentinels around the house itself, which
served as hospital, and to send a corporal’s guard
into the building with orders to dispose themselves
as Kilgariff might direct.</p>

<p>Kilgariff, who had stripped the chevrons off
his sleeves, and sewed a captain’s three bars on
his collar in obedience to General Early’s order,
immediately entered the house and made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
way to the separate room in which Campbell’s
cot had been placed. Kilgariff turned to the
corporal of the guard, and commanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Place two sentinels in that outer room.
Order them to see to it that there is no eavesdropping.
You understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, Captain.”</p>

<p>There is this advantage about military over
other arrangements, that they can be absolutely
depended upon. The sentinel who has “orders”
is an autocrat in their execution. He has no
discretion. He enters into no argument. He
parleys with nobody, whatever that somebody’s
rank may be. He simply commands, “Halt”;
and if the one advancing takes one other step,
the sentinel fires a death shot at short range
and with absolutely certain aim. Killing, on the
part of a sentinel whose command of “Halt” is
disregarded, is not only no crime in military law&mdash;it
is a virtue, a simple discharge of peremptory
duty. And the sentinel himself, if ordered to
stand twenty feet away from a door, stands
there, not encroaching upon the distance by so
much as a foot, under pain of punishment “in
the discretion of a court-martial,” as the military
law phrases it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>So, when Kilgariff entered the room in which
the man who had ruined his life lay wounded,
in answer to that man’s summons, he knew that
his conversation would be neither interrupted
nor overheard in any word or syllable of it.
The absoluteness of military law and practice
forbade that, even as a possibility.</p>

<p>Kilgariff advanced to the man’s bedside, took
his seat upon a camp stool, and without the
remotest suggestion of a greeting in his voice
or manner, abruptly said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am here. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I was sure you would come,” answered the
man; “the safe-conduct&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I tore that up the moment I received it,”
answered Kilgariff.</p>

<p>“But why? It was valid.”</p>

<p>“For any other officer in our army, yes,”
answered Kilgariff; “but not for me, as you
very well know. Anyhow, I preferred to come
under the safe-conduct of Southern carbines
and cannon and sabres. Never mind that. Go
on. What do you want?”</p>

<p>The man winced and groaned with pain as he
turned himself a little on his cot in order to face
his interlocutor. Presently he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m shot through the groin with a canister
ball. It is a wound unto death, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well? What else? I did not come
to ask after your health.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. I mention my condition
only as a man who flings a card upon the table
at a critical moment exclaims, ‘That’s a trump.’
You see, the things I want to say to you are in
the nature of an ante-mortem statement, and I
want you to understand that, so that you may
believe all I have to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Kilgariff. “You are
precisely the sort of man, who, after lying and
cheating all his life, would tell the truth in a
dying statement, if only by way of cheating the
Day of Judgment and playing stacked cards on
the Almighty. Go on.”</p>

<p>But before the man could speak again, Kilgariff
added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As a still further stimulus to truth-telling
on your part, let me make a few suggestions.
You are completely in my power. If I choose,
I can have you taken hence to General Early
and introduce you to him as a man who accepted
a commission in the Confederate Army and then
deserted to the other side and deceived the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
there into giving him a commission to
fight the cause he had solemnly sworn to support.
You know what would happen in such a
case.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. There’d be a drumhead court-martial,
and I’d be hanged at daybreak. But
hear me, Kilgariff. I’m a gambler, as you know,
not in one way, but in all ways. And I know
how to be a good loser. I’ve drawn a very bad
hand this time, but I’ve called the game; and if
I’m hanged for it, I shall not whine about my
luck. Whenever I die, and however I die, I’ll die
game. So you can’t intimidate me. But before
I die, there are certain things I want to tell
you&mdash;for the sake of the others. For although I
have no moral principles and don’t profess any,
there are some things I want to tell you about&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on. Tell me about my brother.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t what I wanted to talk about
first. Besides, you know most of the story.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. I want to hear it all from
your lips. Much of it I never understood. Tell
it all and quickly.”</p>

<p>“Well, your brother’s a fool, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. Otherwise&mdash;never mind that.
Tell me the whole story. How far was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
brother a sharer in your guilt? How far did he
consent to my wrecking? Why did he join you
for my destruction, after all I had done for
him?”</p>

<p>“It’s very hard to say. Opinions differ, and
standards of morality&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Damn opinions and standards!&mdash;especially
yours. I want the facts&mdash;all of them, to the
last detail. Go on, and don’t waste time.”</p>

<p>“Well, your brother is a fool, as I said before,
though in the end he did ‘make his jack’ and
win a pot of money. But that was good luck&mdash;not
good play.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fall into reflections,” interrupted Kilgariff,
seeing that Campbell was in a reminiscent
mood. “We’ve no time for that sort of thing.
Go on with the facts.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see your brother was that sort of
man about whom people say that he was ‘more
sinned against than sinning.’ He always wanted
to do right, and if he could have got a good steady
job as a millionaire, I don’t know anybody who
would have been more scrupulously upright
than he. You see, he really thought he had
principles&mdash;moral character and that sort of
thing&mdash;when he hadn’t anything of the kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Many people deceive themselves in that way. I
never did. I was born of as good a family as
yours, or any other. I was raised in the most
honourable traditions, and as a young man I was
reckoned a pattern of high-minded conduct. I
knew all the time that I had no moral character,
no principles. Or rather, I gradually became
conscious of that fact.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff was exceedingly impatient of this
autobiography, but he thought the shortest way
to the man’s facts was to let him talk on in his
own way. So he forebore to interrupt, and
Campbell continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I would have killed any man who called me
a liar, but I never hesitated to lie when lying
seemed to me of advantage. I was scrupulous
in paying my debts and discharging every social
duty, but I knew myself well enough to know
that if an opportunity came to me to rob any
man without being found out, I would do it
and not hesitate or repent over it. Like the
great majority of men, I was honest only as a
matter of policy. I had no moral character.
Most people haven’t any, but they go on thinking
they have and pretending about it until they
completely deceive themselves. They refuse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
take the old sage’s advice to ‘know thyself.’ I
took it. I early learned to know myself.</p>

<p>“But if I had no principles, I at least had
sentiments. One of those sentiments was pride
in my family. When I saw clearly that I was
going to be an adventurer, a gambler, a swindler,
a man living by his wits, I did not shrink from
that, but I shuddered at the thought of disgracing
the name I bore. So I decided not to bear
that name, but to choose another. At first I
thought of calling myself ‘George Washington
Bib’&mdash;just for the humour of the thing. The
sudden slump from the resonance of ‘George
Washington’ to the monosyllabic inconsequence
of ‘Bib’ struck me as funny. But I reflected
that while I had never heard of anybody named
Bib, there might be people by that name.
Still further, it occurred to me that anybody on
being introduced to George Washington Bib
would be sure to remember the name, and in
the career I had marked out for myself that
might be inconvenient. So I made up my
mind to call myself Campbell. There are so
many families of that name, and they are so
prolific, that the mere name means nothing&mdash;not
even a probability of kinship. But you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
not interested in all this. You want to hear
about your brother.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Kilgariff.</p>

<p>“Well, your brother was highly respectable,
as you know. He was comfortably rich at the
first, and after he lost most of his money he
struggled hard to keep up the pretence of being
still comfortably rich. He did the thing very
cleverly, and it let him into several pretty good
things in Wall Street. But it let him into a
good many very bad things also, and in his
over-anxiety to become really rich again, he
went into the bad things headforemost and
blindfold. I was posing as a lawyer then, you
know, and cutting a large swath. I really had
no regular practice of any consequence, but I
kept two large suites of offices and any number
of clerks, as a blind, and I managed every now
and then to find out things that I could turn to
account&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Blackmail, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you’d call it that, but always
with a weather eye on the law. You see, when
an active lawyer finds out that a big banker has
been doing things he oughtn’t, the big banker
is apt to conclude that he needs the services of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
precisely that particular lawyer as private counsel.
There are big fees in the business sometimes,
but it’s risky and uncertain. So I had
my ups and downs. I was in one of the very
worst of my downs when this bank affair fell in.
I had been a bank examiner at one time, and
had twice examined the affairs of this bank. I
knew that its deposits were enormous and its
assets sufficient, if properly handled, to pay out
everything and leave a large surplus, besides
something for the receiver. So I decided to become
in effect, though not in fact, the receiver.
I owned a judge. He owed me money which
he couldn’t pay, and that money was owing on
account of things which he couldn’t on any consideration
allow to be inquired into in ‘proceedings.’
Moreover, I knew a lot of other things
which in themselves made me his master.
Still again, his term was nearly at an end, and I
had the political influence necessary to secure
or defeat his renomination and re-election, as I
might choose. In short, I owned him body and
soul. So, when it fell to him to appoint a receiver
for this bank, he naturally sent for me in
consultation. His idea was to appoint me to
the receivership, but I saw clearly that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would not do. It would raise a row, for I was
pretty well known to the big financiers, many
of whom had been obliged to employ me by
way of silencing me at one time or another.
But more important than that was the fact that
the plans I had formed for the handling of the
bank’s affairs involved a good deal of risk to the
receiver. The bank had a great many investments
that must be closed out in order to put
the institution on its feet again, and there are
various ways of closing out such investments.
It was my idea that they should be so closed out
as to leave the bank just barely solvent and
able to pay its depositors, you understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and that you and your pals should
pocket the surplus.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I didn’t imagine you had so
good a head for business.”</p>

<p>“Never mind my head. Consider your own
neck, and go on with the story.”</p>

<p>“Now won’t you understand,” said the adventurer,
“that I’m not thinking about my
neck? I’ve staked that as my ’ante’ in this
game, and I never ask the ante back. Well,
I showed my judge that it wouldn’t do at all to
make me receiver, but I told him I would find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
him the right man. Your brother had already
occurred to me as available. He was in extreme
financial difficulties at that time. He was in arrears
in his club dues, and his tailor’s bills, and
even to his servants. He had sold out every
bond and every share of stock he owned, and
still his debts were sorely pressing him. He
lived at a fine though small place just out of
town, where he and his wife and daughters entertained
sumptuously. For even to his wife
and daughters he kept up the pretence of being
comfortably rich, so that they had no hesitation
in giving orders at the caterers’ and the florists’
and directing that the bills be sent to him.</p>

<p>“I knew his condition. I knew that he was
passing sleepless nights in dreadful apprehension
of the quickly coming time when the florists
and the caterers would surely refuse to fill the
orders of his wife and daughters on the ground
that he owed them and didn’t pay.</p>

<p>“One day I sent for him to dine with me in a
private room at an expensive hotel. I vaguely
suggested to him that his fortune was made;
that within a few days I should be able to put
him in position to twiddle his fingers at the
florists and the caterers. But I gave him no details.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
I gave him limitless champagne instead,
and, as my digestion resented champagne at
that time, I excused myself from drinking more
than a very small share of the enticing beverage.
We decided to play poker, after dinner, just for
amusement. The chips were valued high&mdash;a
dollar for a white chip, two and a half for a red,
and five dollars for a blue.</p>

<p>“For a time your brother had marvellous
‘luck.’ He won enough of my paper promises
to pay to make him feel already quite independent
of the caterers and the florists, and to
convince him that at poker I was exceedingly
easy prey to a man who ‘really understood the
game,’ as he conceitedly thought he did. Well,
we played on till morning; and when sunrise
came, he had given me his I O U’s for more
money than he had ever owned in his life.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you had made him drunk on
champagne, and then had cheated him without
limit?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, that’s about it. Anyhow, I owned
him. After he had got over the headache and
the champagne, he came to me at my office to
see what could be done by way of compromise.
I told him that I had no money and no resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
except my wits; I frankly confessed that but
for certain cash payments he had made early in
the game, I could not have paid for the hotel
room and tipped the waiters to the tune that
waiters set when they are privy to a game of
that kind.</p>

<p>“‘But it’s all right,’ I assured him. ‘Don’t
bother about the I O U’s. They’ll keep. They
are debts of honour, of course, but they needn’t
be paid till it is convenient to pay them; and
when you go into the position that I’ve secured
for you, it will be not only convenient, but exceedingly
easy.’</p>

<p>“Then I told him about the receivership and
my purpose to have him appointed. I explained
that in the mere matter of commissions it would
give him a princely income, to say nothing of
perquisites. I didn’t explain what ‘perquisites’
in such a case meant. That was because I had
no moral character. He didn’t ask. That was
because he thought he had a moral character
and wished to spare it affront.</p>

<p>“It was easily arranged that the judge I
owned should appoint as receiver the man I
owned. But I didn’t own my man completely,
as yet. He owed me more money, as a debt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of honour, than he could pay at that time; but
once in the receivership, he could quickly pay
off all that, and then I shouldn’t own him at
all. Indeed, he might have repudiated the
I O U’s as illegal gambling debts; he might
have refused to pay them at all. But I wasn’t
afraid of that. Your brother fondly imagined
that he was a man of honour, of high moral
principle, and so I knew that in order to keep
up that pretence with himself he would stand
by his debts of honour. But I foresaw that he
might presently discharge them all, out of the
proceeds of the receivership, and send me
adrift. I must get a stronger grip on him.
So I told my judge to send for him and say
certain things to him.</p>

<p>“‘You must setup a house,’ the judge told
him, ‘in a fashionable quarter of the town, by
way of maintaining your position. You see,
it won’t do for me to put anybody in charge of
those many millions who isn’t recognised as
himself a man of independent wealth. You
must have a good house and enlarge your establishment.
The receivership will abundantly
recoup you in the end, but from the beginning
we must keep up appearances.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your brother came to me in great distress
of mind to tell me what the judge had required
of him. He frankly told me he hadn’t the
money necessary to make a first payment on
the lease of a town house, to furnish it suitably,
and to establish himself in it. I pretended to
be worried over the matter, and I took twenty-four
hours in which to think about it. Then
I sent for your brother again and told him I
saw a way out; that certain clients of mine
had money to invest on bond and mortgage,
and had placed it in my hands; that by a
little stretching of my authority I could let
him have the amount he needed, as a mortgage
loan on his place in the country. I saw his
face fall when I suggested this, as I had expected
to see it fall. Presently he explained
that in order to give a mortgage on his country
place, which really stood in his wife’s name and
had in fact come to her as a dowry, he must
get her to execute the papers. That would be
very awkward, he explained, as he had never
thought it necessary to bother his womankind
about his affairs. To ask his wife to execute
a mortgage would necessitate a statement to
her of his financial position, and a whole lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
more of that sort, which I had expected. I
told him I thought I could arrange the matter;
that my clients had placed their affairs completely
in my hands; that all they wanted was
the prompt payment of interest and adequate
security for their invested money; that the
profits of the receivership would be ample to
secure all this; and that any arrangement I
might make would never be questioned by my
clients. I told him that the mortgage security
was after all only a matter of form in a case
where the other security was so ample, and
that the whole thing was in my hands. So I
suggested that he should&mdash;as a mere matter
of form&mdash;execute the mortgage, himself signing
his wife’s name in her stead. I would take
care of the document, not even recording it,
and the loan could be paid off presently, with
nobody the wiser. Your brother fell into the
trap. He executed the mortgage, signing his
wife’s name to it, and he was at once made
receiver of the bank.</p>

<p>“From that hour, of course, he was my property.
No negro slave in all the South was
ever more completely owned, or more absolutely
under the control of his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had only to reveal the facts at any moment
in order to send him to jail. He had
committed a felony&mdash;he, the highly respectable
receiver of a savings bank, and a man regarded
as a leader in social and even in religious movements
of every kind. I held complete proofs
of his felony in my own hands. He must do
my bidding or go to State’s prison.</p>

<p>“My first order to him was to put me into
the bank as counsel to the receiver, at a good
salary, and also as expert accountant, at another
good salary. The bank could afford all this
and vastly more. Its assets were easily three
times its liabilities&mdash;if properly handled, and
I knew how to handle them. I meant no harm
to your brother. On the contrary, I meant to
make him rich and let him retire from the completed
receivership with the commendation of
the court for the masterly manner in which he
had so handled the affairs of the institution as
to make good every dollar of its deposits with
interest, and to deliver it into the hands of its
trustees again in a perfectly solvent condition.
You see, the assets were ample for that, and
to provide for my future besides. The only
trouble before had been bad management and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
a deficient knowledge of the art of bookkeeping
on the part of the respectable old galoots who
had been in control of the bank. They might
easily have straightened out everything without
any court proceedings at all, if they had known
how. Their violations of the law had been
purely technical&mdash;such as occur in every bank
every day&mdash;and these things can always be
arranged on a good basis of assets, if the
people in charge only know how.</p>

<p>“Now, when I began operations in the bank,
your brother was inclined to object to some of
the things I did. I had only to remind him
of the mortgage papers in order to reduce him
to subjection. He still thought he had a moral
character, and so when I proposed to sell out
the bank’s securities at ten or twenty or fifty
per cent less than their value, and take a commission
of five or ten or forty per cent for ourselves
from the buyers, he raised grave moral
objections. But he was in no position to insist
upon them, and besides he was largely profiting
by the transactions. Meanwhile, I was slowly
getting the bank’s affairs into shape&mdash;very
slowly, for there were the salaries of him and
myself to be considered. Then came the revolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the chief bookkeeper, and his complaint that
we were robbing the bank. I tried hard to
square him, but he wouldn’t square. That
fellow really had a moral character, and, worse
still, he couldn’t be scared. I showed him that
as he had already permitted false entries in the
bank’s books, he must himself be involved in
any exposure that might be made. He answered
that he knew that, and was prepared
to explain matters in court and ‘take the consequences.’
Then your brother got scared half
to death, and consulted you. If he had waited for
forty-eight hours, I should have had that bookkeeper
in jail, and your brother would have got
credit for extreme vigilance. But when he sent
for you, all was up. You came into the bank
and practically took your brother’s place and
function. But you neglected to provide yourself
with legal authority to be in the bank at
all. Another thing you didn’t reckon upon
was my foresight. I had taken pains to win
several of the clerks and bookkeepers to my
side. I had ‘let them in,’ so that when you
angrily dismissed me, I still had daily and
hourly information of what was going on. You
found out that the bank’s securities had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
sold for less than they were worth, and you set
to work to repair the wrong. You couldn’t
cancel the sales that had been made, but you
could and did pay your own money into the
bank to make good what you regarded as the
defalcations. That made it easy for me. I
went to my judge&mdash;the one I owned&mdash;and
laid before him the fact that you were handling
the bank’s assets without a shadow of legal
authority; that you had dismissed me&mdash;the
receiver’s counsel and expert accountant&mdash;upon
discovering that I knew of defalcations, and all
the rest of it. You know that part of the story,
for you suffered from it. To save your brother,
you had sacrificed large sums of money. When
that failed and you found that either he or you
must go to prison for these defalcations, you
decided to sacrifice your liberty and your reputation
in order to save him and his wife and
daughters. You refused to defend yourself.
I thought your plan was to get a stay, give
bail, and skip it. But you had the disadvantage
of having a moral character, so you stood
your hand and were sent to prison. Your
brother, having no moral character, let you
do this thing and pretended great grief over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
your dishonesty and perfidy. But he had
learned the business by that time, and so he
got away with the swag, and with the reputation
of a man of truly Roman virtue who suffered
acutely over the misbehaviour of his
‘black sheep’ brother. What a farce it all is
anyhow&mdash;life, I mean&mdash;if one tries to take
it seriously! Let me have a little brandy,
please! I’m growing very faint.”</p>

<p>The brandy did its appointed work of stimulation,
and presently Campbell resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t in the least understand why you
should care for your brother, but, as you do, it
may gratify you to know that he is leading a
quiet life of luxury in the country on the Hudson.
He is a comfortably rich man; for he
kept the money he got out of the bank and
invested it prudently&mdash;a thing I never could
do when I had money. He highly disapproved
of me, of course; but when I quitted the Southern
army and went North&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When you deserted, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you look at it in that way&mdash;he used
his influence to get me my present commission.
That was cheaper than supporting me, which
he must otherwise have done, for I had lost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
squandered everything. That brings me to what
I really want to talk to you about. I have a
daughter somewhere in the South, if she is still
alive. She was captured a few months ago during
an effort on the part of&mdash;well, never mind
whom&mdash;to smuggle her through the lines into
the South, where she has some relatives, though
I don’t believe she knows who they are. It
doesn’t matter. They say I’ve persecuted the
girl&mdash;and I suppose in a way I have.</p>

<p>“Never mind that. I’m sinking fast now
and haven’t any time for explanations. I have
some papers here that may mean everything
to her after she comes of age. She has been
taught that she is only seventeen years old.
In fact, she is nineteen, and she must have
these papers when she is twenty-one. I sent
for you to ask you to find her and deliver them.
You really have a moral character, and so you
won’t trade on this matter. With your wide
acquaintance, you’ll know how to find the girl.
Her name is Evelyn Byrd.”</p>

<p>If a shell had exploded in the room, Kilgariff
would not have been so startled as he was by
this announcement. But he had no time for
questions. He had heard picket-firing for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
minutes past, and his practised ear told
him with certainty that the rattle of the musketry
was steadily drawing nearer. He knew
what that meant. The Federals were advancing
in adequate force for the recapture of the
position and the destruction of Major Irby’s
little handful of men.</p>

<p>A few minutes before Campbell made his
startling announcement, a note had come to
Kilgariff from Major Irby, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Enemy advancing in considerable force, but
I can hold place for an hour or more if absolutely
necessary. You needn’t hurry. Only
cut it as short as you can.”</p>

<p>But just at the moment of the mention of
Evelyn Byrd’s name, the voices of two rifled
cannon were heard near at hand, and Kilgariff
knew the guns for his own. Instantly he sprang
up, and, taking the papers from Campbell’s hand,
passed out of the house without a word of farewell,
leaped upon his horse, and galloped to the
little hill where his guns had been posted.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of early dawn, and even
considerable bodies of troops could not be seen
except at short distances. But the enemy was
pressing Major Irby hard, apparently bent
upon capturing his force. Both his flanks
were threatened, while his centre was specially
hard pressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had Kilgariff reported that his
mission was finished, and that he was himself
with the guns, than Irby gave some rapid commands,
threw his whole force upon the enemy
with great impetuosity, and then, while the recoil
before his charge lasted, swung his little
band about and made good its escape at a
gallop.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">OWEN KILGARIFF was now beset
with perplexities. So long as he
should continue to serve with Early
in the valley, he must retain the rank of captain
which that commander had forced upon him,
and this he was determined not to do. He
knew that Early had reported upon his case,
and that very certainly a commission would
come to him in regular form from Richmond.
He foresaw that its coming would greatly increase
his embarrassment. He could not decline
it except officially through General Early,
to whom, of course, he could give no satisfactory
reason for his erratic course.</p>

<p>Then, too, he was puzzled about the papers
that Campbell had given him. These clearly
belonged to Evelyn, and his first impulse was
to send them to her and let her do what she
would with them. But he remembered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Campbell’s injunction had been, or seemed to
be, to deliver the documents into her hands
only when she attained the age of twenty-one
years. Not knowing what might be in the
papers, Kilgariff could not know what or how
much of harm might come to her from their
premature delivery.</p>

<p>It is true that he had given no promise to
Campbell, and as for the wishes of the adventurer,
Kilgariff was in no way bound to respect
them, and certainly he was not disposed to do
so. His sole concern in the matter was for
Evelyn’s welfare, and he could not make up his
mind what his course of conduct ought to be
with respect to that. He needed counsel very
sorely, and there was only one man in all the
South of whom he could freely ask counsel.
That man was Arthur Brent, who might be
still at Petersburg, or might have gone back to
his laboratory work at Wyanoke.</p>

<p>In either case, consultation with him seemed
equally out of the question. No confidence was
to be placed in mails at that disturbed time, and
of course Kilgariff would not ask for or accept
even the sick furlough which the increasing
inflammation of his neglected wound rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
exceedingly desirable, so long as there was well-nigh
continuous fighting in progress at the front.</p>

<p>Altogether, Owen Kilgariff was sorely beset
with puzzling uncertainty of mind. He was in
action during most of the day after the night
he had spent with Campbell, but neither weariness
nor loss of sleep enabled him to close his
eyes during the following night. He lay throughout
the hours of darkness stretched upon the
ground under a great chestnut tree, weary but
with wide-open eyes, staring upward at the stars
that showed through the leaves, and thinking to
no purpose.</p>

<p>One thought occurred to him at last which
caused him suddenly to sit up, and for a moment
made his heart bound.</p>

<p>His vigil of ceaseless thought and perplexity
had taught him much of his own soul’s condition
which he had but vaguely guessed at before. It
had shown him clearly what his feeling was toward
Evelyn Byrd. He understood now, as he
had not done before, that his love for the girl was
the supreme passion of his life&mdash;the limitless,
all-embracing, all-conquering impulse of a strong
nature which had schooled itself to repression
and self-sacrifice. He saw clearly that all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
self-discipline&mdash;greatly as it had enabled him
to endure and to make sacrifice&mdash;had given him
no strength adequate to his present need. He
had thought to conquer his passionate love; he
knew now that he could never conquer it. He
had thought to put it out of his mind as a longing
for the unattainable; he knew now that it
would for ever refuse to be dismissed.</p>

<p>“So long as I live,” he thought, “I must bear
this burden; so long as I live, I must suffer and
be still. For I shall at any rate retain too much
of manhood and courage to win Evelyn’s love or
to sadden her life by linking it with my own.
My honour, at any rate, shall remain unspotted.
Fortunately, a bullet or a sabre stroke is likely
to solve all my riddles for me before this year
comes to an end&mdash;and so much the more imperative
is it that I arrange quickly for the disposal
of her papers to her best advantage. But what
is best? If these papers reveal to her the cruel
fact that her father was an adventurer, a gambler,
a swindler&mdash;and they must if they reveal
anything&mdash;will it not be a great wrong to let her
have them at all? And yet who but herself has
a right to decide that she shall not receive whatever
revelation the documents may make?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was that the thought came to Kilgariff
which made him sit up suddenly.</p>

<p>“She is the daughter of that man. Is there
not in that fact an offset to my disability? Am
I not free to tell her concerning myself, after
she has learned her own origin, and to stand
with eyes on a level with her own, asking her to
be my wife?”</p>

<p>No sooner had he formulated the thought
thus than he rejected it as unworthy. For a time
he scourged himself for permitting the suggestion
to arise in his mind, but presently he comforted
himself by recalling the words of a great
divine who, speaking of evil thoughts quickly
dismissed, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I cannot prevent the birds from flying over
my head, but I can forbid them to make nests
in my hair.”</p>

<p>“I will not let that bird make a nest in my
hair,” thought Kilgariff, resolutely, and greatly to
the relief of his troubled conscience.</p>

<p>At that moment the reveille sounded in all the
camps, and Kilgariff rose to his feet, stripped
himself to the waist, sluiced his head, shoulders,
and chest in the cold water of a neighbouring
spring, resumed his clothing, and was ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the day’s duties, whatever their nature might be.
But his vigil had not brought him any nearer
than he was before to the solution of the problems
that so greatly perplexed him. It had only
added a new and distressing self-knowledge to
the burdens that weighed upon his mind. He
had never feared death; now he looked upon
it as a chance of welcome release from a sorely
burdened life. Thenceforth he thought of the
bullets as friendly messengers, one of which
might bear a message for him.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XV</h2>

<p class="pch">IN THE TRENCHES</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">OPERATIONS in front of Petersburg
had by this time settled down into a
sullenly obstinate struggle for mastery
between the two finest armies of veterans that
ever met each other anywhere in the world. It
is no exaggeration to characterise those armies
by such superlatives. For in them it was not
only organisations&mdash;regiments, brigades, and
divisions&mdash;that were war-seasoned, but the individual
men themselves. They had educated
themselves by four years of fighting into a
personal perfection of soldiership such as has
nowhere else been seen among the rank and
file of contending armies.</p>

<p>The slender lines of hastily constructed earthworks
behind which these two opposing hosts
had confronted each other at the beginning of
that supreme struggle of the war, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
wrought into other and incalculably stronger
forms by work that had never for one moment
ceased and would not pause until the end.</p>

<p>The breastworks had been raised, broadened,
and strengthened under the direction of skilled
engineers. At every salient angle a regular
fort of some sort had been constructed and
heavily armed for offence and defence.</p>

<p>In rear of these lines every little eminence
had been crowned by a frowning fortification,
as sullen in appearance and as capable of destructive
work as the Redan or the Malakoff at
Sebastopol.</p>

<p>At brief intervals along the outer lines traverses
had been built at right angles to the works,
as a protection against all enfilading fire.</p>

<p>The fields just behind the lines were intricately
laced with trenches and protective earthworks
of every kind. Without these the men
in front would have been completely cut off
from communication with the rear, by a resistless,
all-consuming fire.</p>

<p>Great covered ways&mdash;protected passages&mdash;were
cut as the only avenues by which men or
supplies could be moved even for the shortest
distances. Every spring that could yield water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
with which to quench the thirst of the fighting
men was defended by jealous fortifications.</p>

<p>There was no more thought now of enumerating
the actions fought, or naming them. There
was one continuous battle, ceaseless by day or
by night, in which dogged resistance opposed
itself daily and hourly to desperate assault, both
inspired by a courage that did not so much resemble
anything human as it did the struggle of
opposing and titanic natural forces. Did the
reader ever see the breaking up of the ice in a
great river or lake, under the angry impulse of
flood and storm? As the great ice floes in that
case assailed the rocks with seemingly resistless
fury, and as the rocks stood fast in the courage
of their immovability, so at Petersburg the opposing
forces met, day after day, with the courage
and determination of inanimate forces.</p>

<p>Every great gun that either side could bring
from any quarter was placed in position, so that
the fire, continuous by day and by night, grew
steadily greater in volume and more destructive
in effect.</p>

<p>In this matter of guns, as well as in numbers
of men, the Federals had enormous advantage.
They had arsenals and foundries equipped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the most improved machinery to supply them,
and they could draw freely upon the armouries
of Europe, besides. The Confederates had no
such resources. The few and small shops within
their command were antiquated in their equipment
and very sharply limited in their capacity.
But they did their best.</p>

<p>As soon as regular siege operations began,
the Federals set to work establishing mortar
batteries at every available point. Mortars are
very short guns fired at a high “elevation”;
that is, pointing upward at an angle of forty-five
degrees to the horizon, or more than that,
so as to throw shells high in air and let them
fall perpendicularly upon an enemy’s works,
breaking down defences and reaching points in
rear of works to which ordinary cannon fire cannot
penetrate.</p>

<p>The lines were so close together&mdash;at one
point only fifty yards apart&mdash;that everything
had to be done under cover of some kind, and
thus mortars became a vitally necessary arm
with which to break down the enemy’s cover.
The Confederates had none of these guns at
first, but their foundries were at least capable
of manufacturing so simple a weapon in a rude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
but effective fashion, making the mortars of
iron instead of brass, and mounting them in
oaken blocks heavily banded with wrought iron.
In a very brief time the mortars began to arrive,
and their numbers rapidly increased, but there
were very few of the officers who knew how to
handle a weapon so wholly different from ordinary
guns both in construction and in methods
of use.</p>

<p>This scarcity of mortar-skilled officers in the
lower grades gave Owen Kilgariff his opportunity.
The thought occurred to him suddenly
on the day after his vigil, and he acted upon it
at once.</p>

<p>He wrote to Arthur Brent, addressing his
letter to Wyanoke, whence it would of course
be forwarded should Doctor Brent be at Petersburg
still.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I want you, Arthur [he wrote], to use your influence
in my behalf in a matter that touches me closely.
For several reasons I want to be ordered from this
place to Petersburg. For one thing, there is a matter
of business, vitally interesting to you and me and
closely involving the welfare of others. I simply must
see you concerning it without delay. If I can get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Petersburg, I can see you, for Wyanoke is near enough
to the beleaguered city for you to visit me in the
trenches. There are other reasons, but the necessity
of seeing you is the most important and the least personal
to myself, so I need not bother you now with
the other considerations that move me to desire this
change, which you can bring about if you will&mdash;and
I am sure you will.</p>

<p>I should ask for the transfer of the battery now
under my command, if I did not know that it would
be idle to do so. For some reason General Early
seems to have taken a fancy to me, and still more to
two highly improved rifle guns that I recently added
to the battery by capture. He will never let me go
unless compelled by orders to do so.</p>

<p>But I see another way. I learn that our mortar
fire at Petersburg is less effective than it should be, by
reason of our lack of battery officers skilled in handling
that species of ordnance. Now that is a direction
in which I could render specially valuable service, not
only by commanding many mortar pits myself, and
instructing the men, but also by teaching our unskilled
battery officers what to do with such guns, and
how to do it. If you will personally see General Lee’s
chief of artillery and lay the case before him, I am
sure he will order me transferred to the trenches.
You can tell him that I was graduated at Annapolis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
taking special honours in gunnery. You need tell
him no more of my personal history than that after
graduation I resigned from the navy to study medicine,
and that you learned to know me well in our
student days at Jena, Berlin, and Paris.</p>

<p>Do this thing for me, Arthur, and do it as quickly
as possible. And as soon as I reach Petersburg, make
some occasion to see me there, bearing in mind that
to see you with reference to matters of vital importance
to others is my primary purpose in asking for
this transfer.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Arthur Brent was at Wyanoke when this letter
came, but he hastened to Petersburg to execute
his friend’s commission. He told more of
Kilgariff’s personal history than Kilgariff had
suggested. That is to say, he told of his gallantry
at Spottsylvania and of its mention in
general orders. He had neither to urge nor
beseech. No sooner was the chief of artillery
made aware of the facts than he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I want such a man badly. Orders for his
immediate transfer to the lines here shall go
to-day.”</p>

<p>So it came about that before the end of that
week, Owen Kilgariff stood in a drenching
rain-storm and nearly up to his knees in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
mud of a mortar pit at Petersburg, bombarding
a salient in the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p>The storm of bullets and rifle shells that
raged around his pits was as ceaseless as the
downpour of rain, but as calmly as a schoolmaster
expounding a lesson in algebra, he alternately
instructed his men and explained to the
half a dozen subaltern officers who had been
sent to him to learn. He was teaching them
the methods of mortar range-finding, the details
of powder-gauging for accuracy, the art of fuse-cutting,
and all the rest of it, when out of a
badly exposed covered way came Doctor Arthur
Brent to greet him.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STARVING TIME</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE stress of war had now fallen upon
every Southern household. Its terrors
had invaded every home. Its
privations made themselves manifest in scanty
food upon tables that had been noted for lavish
and hospitable abundance, and in a score of
other ways. The people of Virginia were not
only standing at bay, heroically confronting an
invading force three or four times outnumbering
their own armies, but at the same time starvation
itself was staring them in the face.</p>

<p>The food supplies of Virginia were exhausted.
Half the State had been trampled over by contending
armies, until it was reduced to a desert
so barren that&mdash;as Sheridan picturesquely
stated the case&mdash;“the crow that flies over it
must carry his rations with him.” The other
half of the State, already stripped to bareness,
was compelled during that terrible summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
almost wholly to support the army at Richmond
and Petersburg and the army in the valley, for
the reason that the means of drawing even
scanty supplies from the well-nigh exhausted
country farther south were practically destroyed.
Little by little Grant had extended
his left southward and westward until it crossed
the Weldon Railroad south of Petersburg, thus
severing that most important line of communication.
In the meanwhile the Federal cavalry
was continually raiding the South Side Railroad
and the Richmond and Danville Line, tearing
up tracks, burning the wooden bridges, and
so seriously interrupting traffic as to render
those avenues of communication with the South
practically valueless, so far at least as the bringing
of supplies for the armies was concerned.</p>

<p>Thus Virginia had not only to bear the
calamities of the war, but also, single-handed,
to maintain the armies in the field, and Virginia
was already stripped to the point of
nakedness.</p>

<p>Yet the people bore all with patriotic cheerfulness.
They emptied their smokehouses,
their corncribs, and their granaries. They
sent even their milky herds to the slaughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
by way of furnishing meat for soldiers’ rations,
and they went thereafter without milk and
butter for lack of cows, as they were already
going without meat. Those of them who were
near enough the lines desolated their poultry
yards, and lived thereafter upon corn pone,
with greens gathered in the fields and such
perishable fruits as could in no wise be converted
into rations.</p>

<p>The army was being slowly destroyed by the
daily losses in the trenches, which, excluding
the greater losses of the more strenuous battles,
amounted to about thirty per cent a month in
the commands that defended the most exposed
points. Thus Owen Kilgariff’s mortar command
of two hundred and ten men lost sixty-two
within a single month, and some others
lost still more heavily for lack of the wise discretion
Kilgariff constantly brought to bear
upon the problem of husbanding the lives and
limbs of his men while getting out of them the
uttermost atom of effective service of which
they were capable.</p>

<p>Whenever a severe mortar fire was opened
upon his line of pits, he would station himself
in a peculiarly exposed position on top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
earth mound that protected his magazine.
From that point he could direct the work of
every gun under his command and at the same
time do much for the protection of his men.
A mortar shell can be seen in the air&mdash;particularly
at night, when its flaming fuse is a torch&mdash;and
its point of contact and explosion can
be calculated with a good deal of precision. It
was Kilgariff’s practice to watch for the enemy’s
shells, and whenever he saw that one of
them was likely to fall within one or other of
his pits and explode there with the certainty
of blowing a whole gun detachment to atoms,
he would call out the numbers of the exposed
pits, whereupon the men within them would
run into the boom-proofs provided for that purpose
and shelter there till the explosion was
over.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, he, posted high upon the
magazine mound, was exposed not only to the
mortar fire that endangered his men, but still
more to a hail-storm of musket bullets and to
a ceaseless flow of rifled cannon shells that
skimmed the edge of his parapet, with fuses so
skilfully timed and so accurately cut that every
shell exploded within a few feet of his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps he was thinking of the kindly bullet
or the friendly shell fragment that was to make
an end of his perplexities. Who knows? Yet
his exposure of himself was not reckless, but
carefully calculated for the preservation of his
men. It was only such as was common among
the Confederate officers at Petersburg, where
the percentage of officers to men among the
killed and wounded was greater than was ever
recorded in any war before or since.</p>

<p>By this exposure of his own person Kilgariff
undoubtedly saved the lives of many of his
men, all of whom were volunteers who had
offered themselves to man a position so dangerous
that the chief of artillery had refused to
order mortars to occupy it, and had reluctantly
consented to its occupation by Kilgariff and
his desperately daring men as volunteers in an
excessively perilous service. He might have
reduced his losses still more if he had been
willing to order his subordinates at the several
groups of pits to expose themselves as he did in
the interest of the men. But this he refused
to do, on the ground that to order it would be
to exact more than even a soldier’s duty requires
of the bravest man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>One of his sergeants&mdash;a boy of fifteen, who
had won promotion by gallantry&mdash;had indeed
emulated his captain’s example in the hope of
sparing his men. But the second time he did
it, a Hotchkiss shell carried away his head and
shoulders, and the world suffered loss.</p>

<p>The hospital service, under such conditions,
was terribly overtaxed, and for relief the plantation
houses were asked to receive and care for
such of the wounded as could in any wise be
removed to their hospitable shelter. Thus,
presently, every half-starving family in the
land was caring for and feeding as best it
could from three to a dozen wounded men.</p>

<p>At Wyanoke Dorothy had met this emergency
by establishing a regular hospital camp,
in which she received and cared for not less
than fifty wounded officers and men. With the
wise foresight that was part of her mental
make-up, and aided by Arthur’s advance perceptions
of what this terrible campaign was
likely to bring forth, Dorothy had begun early
in the spring to prepare for the emergency.
She had withdrawn a large proportion of the
field hands from the cultivation of crops, and
set them at work raising garden stuff instead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
To the same end, she had diverted to her gardens
a large part of the stable fertiliser which
was ordinarily spread upon corn, wheat, or
tobacco lands. She had said to Arthur:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is nothing certain after this year
except disaster. We must meet disaster as
bravely as we can, and leave the future to take
care of itself. I shall devote all our resources
this year, outside the poppy fields, to the production
of food stuffs&mdash;vegetables, fowls, and
pigs&mdash;with which to feed the wounded who
must presently come to us.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Dorothy was able to
care for fifty wounded men at a time, when the
mistresses of other plantations as great as
Wyanoke and Pocahontas found themselves
sorely taxed in taking ten. And as the wounded
men were impatient to get back into the trenches
as soon as their injuries were endurably half
healed, the ministry of mercy at Wyanoke was
brought to bear upon many hundreds of brave
fellows during that most terrible of summers,
and the fame of Dorothy Brent as an angel of
mercy and kindness spread throughout the army,
fairly rivalling that of her mother&mdash;unknown
as such&mdash;Madame Le Sud. Madame Le Sud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
defiant alike of weariness and danger, poured
water down many parched throats on Cemetery
Hill at Petersburg, until at last a Minié ball
made an end of her ministry; and on that same
day a dozen brave fellows fell while carving her
name on a rude boulder which marked the place
of her final sacrifice. The places of those who
fell in this service were promptly taken by
others equally intent, at whatever cost, upon
marking for remembrance the spot on which
that woman gave up her life who had ministered
so heroically to human suffering.</p>

<p>All these things are only incidents illustrative
of that heroism on the part of women which the
poet, if we had a poet, would seize upon as the
vital and essential story of the Confederate war.
If that heroism could be properly celebrated, it
would make a literature worthy to stand shoulder
to shoulder with the hero-songs of old
Homer himself. But that story of woman’s
love and woman’s sacrifice has never been told
and never will be, for the reason that there is
none worthy to tell it among those of us who
survive of those who saw it and knew the self-sacrificing
absoluteness of its heroism.</p>

<p>Into all this work of mercy Evelyn Byrd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
entered not only with enthusiasm, but with the
tireless energy of healthy youth and with a
queer sagacity&mdash;born, perhaps, of her strange
life-experience&mdash;which enabled her sometimes
to double or quadruple the beneficent effects of
her work by the deftness of its doing.</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm in the cause rather astonished
Dorothy, at first. If the girl had been brought
up in Virginia, if her home had always been
there, if she had had a people of her own there,
with a father and a brother in the trenches, her
devotion would have been natural enough. But
none of those reasons for her enthusiasm existed.
She had probably been born in Virginia,
or at least of Virginian parentage, though even
that assumption rested upon no better foundation
than the fact that she bore a historic Virginian
name. She had lived elsewhere during
her childhood and youth. She had come into
the Southern country under compulsion, and
three fourths of the war was over before she
came. So far as she knew, she had no relatives
in Virginia, and very certainly she had none
there whom she knew and loved.</p>

<p>Yet she was passionate almost to madness in
her Virginianism, and she was self-sacrificing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
even beyond the standards of the other heroic
women around her.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">That she should enter passionately into any cause
into which she enters at all [wrote Dorothy to Arthur
during one of his absences at the front] is altogether
natural. Her nature is passionate in an extreme degree,
and, good as her judgment is when it is cool,
she sends it about its business whenever it assumes to
meddle with her passionate impulses. She has certain
well-fixed principles of conduct, from which she never
departs by so much as a hair’s breadth&mdash;chiefly, I
imagine, because they are principles which she has
wrought out in her mind without anybody’s teaching or
anybody’s suggestion. They are the final results of her
own thinking. She regards them as ultimates of truth.
But subject to these, she is altogether a creature of
impulse. Even to save one she loves from great calamity,
she would not think of compromising the most
trivial of her fundamental principles; yet for the sake
of one she loves, she would sacrifice herself illimitably
even upon the most trivial occasion. It is a dangerous
character to possess, but a most interesting one to
study, and certainly it is admirable.</p>

<p class="p1">Arthur smiled lovingly as he read this analysis.
“How little we know ourselves!” he
exclaimed, in thought. “If I had worked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
pen and paper for a month in an effort to
describe Dorothy’s own character fittingly, I
couldn’t have done it so perfectly as she has
done it in describing the make-up of Evelyn.
Yet she never for one moment suspects the
similarity. Just because the external circumstances
are different in the two cases, she is
utterly blind to the parallel. It doesn’t matter.
It is far better to have such a character as
Dorothy’s than to try to create it&mdash;much better
to have it than to know that she has it.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of observation and remark that
in his thinking about this matter of character,
and admiring and loving it, Arthur Brent connected
the subject altogether with Dorothy, not
at all with Evelyn.</p>

<p>That was because Arthur Brent was in love
with his wife, and happy is the man with whom
such a love lingers and dominates after the
honeymoon is over!</p>

<p>One day Dorothy and Evelyn talked of this
matter of Evelyn’s enthusiasm for the Confederate
cause and her passionate devotion to those
who had received wounds in the service of it.
It was Evelyn who started the conversation.</p>

<p>“The best thing about you, Dorothy,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
said, one morning while they two were waiting
for a decoction they were making to drip
through the filtering-paper, “is your devotion
to Cousin Arthur.” Evelyn had come to that
stage of Virginian culture in which affection
expressed itself in the claiming of kinship where
there was none. “It seems to me that that is
the way every woman should feel toward her
husband, if he is worthy of it, as Cousin Arthur
is.”</p>

<p>“Tell me your whole thought, Byrdie,” answered
Dorothy, who had fastened that pet
name upon her companion. “It interests me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see I haven’t seen much of this
sort of thing between husbands and wives,
though I am satisfied it ought to exist in every
marriage. I heard a woman lecture once on
what she called the ‘Subjection of Women.’
She made me so angry that I wanted to answer
her&mdash;mere slip of a girl that I was&mdash;but they&mdash;well,
I wasn’t let. That isn’t good English,
I know, but it is what I mean. The woman
wanted to strike the word ‘obey’ out of the
marriage service, just as if the form of a marriage
ceremony had anything to do with a real
marriage. As well as I could make out her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
meaning, she wanted every woman to enter
upon wedlock with fixed bayonets, with her
glove in the ring, and with a challenge upon
her lips. I don’t believe in any such marriage
as that. I regard it as an infamous degradation
of a holy relation. It isn’t marriage at all.
It is a mere bargain, like a contract for supplies
or any other contract. You see, I had never
seen a perfect marriage like yours and Cousin
Arthur’s at that time, but I had thought about
it, because I had seen the other kind. It was
my idea that in a true marriage the wife would
obey for love, while for love the husband would
avoid commanding. I don’t think I can explain&mdash;but
you understand me, Dorothy&mdash;you must
understand, because it is just so with you and
Cousin Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand,” answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Of course you do. You are never so happy
as in doing whatever you think Cousin Arthur
would like you to do, and he never wants you to
do anything except what it pleases you to do.
I reckon the whole thing may be ciphered down
to this: you love Cousin Arthur, and Cousin Arthur
loves you; each wants the other to be free
and happy, and each acts as is most likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
produce that result. I can’t think of any better
way than that.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” answered Dorothy, with two
glad tears glistening on her cheeks; “and I am
glad that you understand. I can’t imagine anything
that could be better for you than to think in
that way. But tell me, Byrdie, why you are so
enthusiastic in our Southern cause and in your
ministry to our wounded soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Because your cause is my cause. I haven’t
any friends in the world but you and Cousin
Arthur, and&mdash;your friends.”</p>

<p>Dorothy observed that the girl paused before
adding “&mdash;and your friends,” and Dorothy understood
that the girl was thinking of Owen
Kilgariff. To Dorothy it meant much that she
avoided all mention of Kilgariff’s name.</p>

<p>The girl had completely lost her mannerisms
of speech in a very brief while, a fact which
Dorothy attributed to her rare gift of imitation.
Only once in a great while, when she was under
excitement, did she lapse into the peculiarities
either of pronunciation or of construction which
had at first been so marked a characteristic of
her utterance. She read voraciously now, reading
always, apparently, with minute attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to language in her eager desire to learn. Her
time for reading was practically made time.
That is to say, it consisted chiefly of brief intervals
between occupations. She was up every
morning at five o’clock, in order that she might
go to the stables and personally see to it that
the horses and mules were properly fed and
curried.</p>

<p>“The negroes neglect them shamefully when
I am not there in Cousin Arthur’s place,” she
said, “and it is cruel to neglect poor dumb beasts
that cannot provide for themselves or even utter
a complaint.”</p>

<p>As soon after seven as Dorothy’s nursery
duties permitted, the two mounted their horses
and rode away for a half-intoxicating draught of
the air of a Virginia summer morning. Returning
to a nine o’clock “breakfast of rags,” as
Dorothy called the scant, makeshift meal that
alone was possible to them in that time of stress,
Evelyn went at once to the laboratory. After
setting matters going there, she mounted again
and rode away to the camp of the wounded soldiers
to whose needs she ministered with a skill
and circumspection that had been born of her
peculiar experience in remote places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“The best medicine she brings us,” said one
of the wounded men, one day, “is her laugh.”
And yet Evelyn rarely laughed at all. It was
her ever present smile and the general joyousness
of her countenance that the invalids interpreted
as laughter.</p>

<p>She always carried a light shot-gun with her,
and she rarely returned to the “gre’t house”
without three or four squirrels for her own and
Dorothy’s dinner. Now and then she filled her
bag with partridges&mdash;or “quails,” as those most
toothsome of game birds are generally, and quite
improperly, called at the North. When September
came, she got an occasional wild turkey also,
her skill both in finding game and in the use of
her gun being unusually good.</p>

<p>One day Dorothy challenged her on this
point.</p>

<p>“You are a sentimentalist on the subject of
animals,” she said, “and yet you are a huntswoman.”</p>

<p>“But why not?” asked Evelyn, in astonishment
at the implied question. “In the summer, the
wild creatures multiply enormously. When the
winter comes, they starve to death because there
is not food enough. In the fall, the woods are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
full of them; in the spring, there are very few.
Nine tenths of them must die in any case, and
if my gun hastens the death of one, it betters
the chance of another to survive. I could never
deceive them, or persuade them to trust me and
then betray their trust. I don’t think I am a
sentimentalist, Dorothy, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Just then Dorothy thought of something else
and said it, and the conversation was diverted
into other channels.</p>

<p>Nearly always Evelyn had a book with her,
which she read at odd moments, and quite always
she had one book or more lying around the
house, each open at the place at which she had
last read, and each lying ready to her hand
whenever a moment of leisure should come in
her very busy day. For besides her attendance
upon the sick, she relieved Dorothy of the
greater part of her household duties, and was
tireless in her work in the laboratory. Her
knowledge of chemistry was scant, of course,
but she had quickly and completely mastered
the processes in use in the laboratory, and her
skill in drug manufacture was greater than that
of many persons more familiar with the technical
part of that work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>She had from the first taken exclusive care
of her own room, peremptorily ordering all the
maids to keep out of it.</p>

<p>“A maid always reminds me,” she said to
Dorothy, by way of offering an explanation
that did not explain; for she did not complete
her sentence. But so earnest was her objection
that, even to the daily polishing of the white
ash floor with a pine needle rubbing, she did
everything within those precincts with her own
hands.</p>

<p>Dorothy let her have her way. It was Dorothy’s
habit to let others do as they pleased so
long as their pleasing was harmless.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">A GUN-PIT CONFERENCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">FOR full half an hour after Arthur Brent
came out of the covered way and greeted
his friend, Kilgariff’s bombardment and
the enemy’s vigorous response continued. Arthur
Brent stood by his friend in the midst of it
all quite as if “the scream of shot, the burst of
shell, and the bellowing of the mortars” had
been nothing more than a harmless exhibition
of “pyrotechny for our neighbour moon,” as
Bailey phrases it in <i>Festus</i>.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Kilgariff to invite Doctor
Brent to take refuge in one of the bomb-proofs
till the fierceness of the fire should be past. It
never did occur to Owen Kilgariff that a gentleman
of education and culture could think of
shrinking from danger, even though, as in this
case, he had nothing to do with the war business
immediately in hand, but was, technically
at least, a non-combatant. Indeed, that gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
corps of doctors who constituted the medical
field-service in the Confederate army never did
regard themselves as non-combatants, at least
so far as going into or keeping out of danger
was concerned. They fired no guns, indeed,
but in all other ways they participated in the
field-fighting on quite equal terms with officers
of the line. Wherever their duty called them,
wherever an errand of mercy demanded their
presence, they went without hesitation and stayed
without flinching. They performed the most
delicate operations, where a moment’s unsteadiness
of hand must have cost a human life, while
shells were bursting about their heads and multitudinous
bullets were whistling in their ears.
Sometimes their patients were blown out of
their hands by a cannon shot. Sometimes the
doctors themselves went to their death while
performing operations on the battlefield.</p>

<p>In one case a surgeon was shot unto death
while holding an artery end. But while waiting
for the death that he knew must come within
the brief space of a few minutes, the gallant
fellow held his forceps firmly and directed his
assistant how to tie the blood vessel. Then he
gave up the ghost, in the very act of thus saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a human life perhaps not worth a hundredth part
of his own. The heroism of war does not lie
altogether with those who make desperate
charges or desperately receive them.</p>

<p>Arthur Brent was high in rank in that medical
corps, the cool courage of whose members, if it
could be adequately set forth, would constitute
as heroic a story as any that has ever been related
in illustration of daring and self-sacrifice,
and he honoured his rank in his conduct. His
duty lay sometimes in the field, whither he went
to organise and direct the work of others, and
sometimes in the laboratory, where no element
of danger existed. In either case he did his
duty with never a thought of self and never a
question of the cost.</p>

<p>On this occasion he stood upon the exposed
mound of the magazine, watching Kilgariff’s
splendid work with the guns, until at last the
bombardment ceased as suddenly and as meaninglessly
as it had begun; for that was the way
with bombardments on those lines.</p>

<p>When at last the fire sank to its ordinary dead
level of ceaseless sharp-shooting, with only now
and then a cannon shot to punctuate the irregular
rattle of the rifles, Kilgariff gave the order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
“Cease firing,” and the clamorous mortars were
stilled. Then he turned to the officers who had
come to him for instruction, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Some of my men have been quick to learn
and are now experts. If any of you gentlemen
desire it, I will send some of the best of them to
you now and then to help you instruct your cannoniers
and your gunners. You will yourselves
impress upon the magazine men the importance
of not compressing the powder in measuring it.
A very slight inattention at that point often
makes a difference of twenty-five or fifty yards
in the range, and so renders worthless and ineffective
a shell which might otherwise do its
work well. If you need the services of any of
my men as tutors to your own, pray call upon
me. Now good evening. I’m sorry I cannot
invite you to sup with me, but I really haven’t
so much as a hard-tack biscuit to offer you.”</p>

<p>When the officers had gone, Kilgariff and
Brent seated themselves on top of the magazine
mound and talked.</p>

<p>“First of all,” said Arthur Brent, “I want to
hear about the things personal to yourself. You
put them aside, in your letter, as of smaller consequence
than the matters, whatever they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
which related to others. I do not so regard
them. So tell me first of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those things have pretty well settled
themselves,” answered Kilgariff, with a touch of
disgust in his tone. “It was only that I very
much wanted to decline this captain’s commission,
under which I have been commanding sixty
mortars and something like a battalion of men
here. General Early fairly forced the rank
upon me, after Captain Pollard lost his leg&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By the way,” interrupted Doctor Brent,
“Pollard is at Wyanoke and convalescent. With
his superb constitution and his lifelong wholesomeness
of living, his recovery has been rapid.
He very much wants to see you. He would like
you to continue in command of his battery&mdash;or
would have liked it if you had not been transferred
to Petersburg. He is a major now, you
know, promoted for gallantry and good service,
and when he returns to duty (which will be
within a day or two) he will have command of
his battalion. Of course, your special qualification
for the work you are doing here forbids
you to go back to your battery. The chief of
artillery would never permit that. But I’m interrupting.
Tell me what you set out to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s all simple enough. You know my
reasons for wishing to be an enlisted man rather
than a commissioned officer. When I wrote to
you, I was acting as captain under General
Early’s peremptory orders, but the commission
he had asked the authorities at Richmond to
send me had not yet come. I knew that if it
should come while I was with Early, he would
never let me decline it. He would have refused
even to forward my declination through the regular
channels. It was my hope to get myself
ordered to Petersburg before the commission
could come.</p>

<p>“In that case, I thought, I could decline it
and take service in my own non-commissioned
rank as sergeant-major and special drill-master
for the mortar batteries. But the commission
came, through Early, on the day before I left
the valley, and when I reported here for duty,
asking to have it cancelled, the chief of artillery
peremptorily refused. He took me to General
Lee’s headquarters and there explained the
situation. General Lee settled the matter by
saying that I could render much better service
with a commission than without one, and that
he ‘desired’ me to act in the capacity to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
I had been commissioned. I had no choice but
to yield to his wish, of course, so I took command
here as captain, and immediately all the
fragments of batteries that had been disintegrated
during the campaign, and especially
those whose officers had been killed or captured,
were turned over to me to be converted into
mortar men.</p>

<p>“They number about two hundred and fifty
men, some of whom are non-commissioned officers,
ranking all the way from corporal to sergeant-major,
so that it is impossible to handle
the command effectively under a single company
organisation. I made a report on the
matter two days ago suggesting that the body
be organised into a number of small, compact
companies, and that some major of artillery
already holding his commission be ordered to
assume control of the whole. To-day came my
reply&mdash;about two hours ago. It was to the
effect that by recommendation of the chief of
artillery, approved by General Lee, I had been
appointed lieutenant-colonel, in command of all
the mortars on this part of the line. I am
instructed to organise this service with a view
to effectiveness, and to report only through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
chief of artillery, without the intervention of
any colonel or brigadier or major-general. I
cannot refuse to obey such orders, given in aid
of effective service. I cannot even ask to be
excused without offering an affront to my superiors
and seeming, at least, to shirk that service
in which they think I can make the best use of
my capacities in behalf of our cause.</p>

<p>“So that matter has settled itself. I shall
have two stars sewed upon my collar to-night,
and to-morrow morning I shall begin the work
of reorganising the mortar service. I shall
encounter very black looks in the countenances
of some of the courteous captains whom you
saw here half an hour ago. They are men who
care for military rank, as I do not, and they will
not be pleased to find themselves overslaughed
by my promotion. They will never believe that
I wish, even more heartily than they can, that
some one of them had been set to do this duty,
and that I might have returned to the ranks.
But a soldier must take what comes. I must
accept their black looks, and their jealousies,
and perhaps even the lasting enmity of some of
them, precisely as I accept the fact of the shells
flung at me by the enemy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment a sergeant approached, and,
saluting, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captain Kilgariff”&mdash;for Kilgariff had not
yet announced his promotion even to his men&mdash;“one
of the men is hurt by a fragment of the
shell that burst over us half a minute ago. He
seems badly wounded.”</p>

<p>Instantly Kilgariff and Arthur Brent hurried
to the pit where the wounded man lay, and
Doctor Brent dressed his wound, which was
serious. At his suggestion, Kilgariff ordered
two of the men to carry the stricken one to
the rear through the covered way, and deliver
him to the surgeons of the nearest field-hospital.</p>

<p>Just as the party started, a huge fifteen-inch
mortar shell descended from a great height,
struck the apex of the earth mound that covered
the magazine, where ten minutes before the two
friends had been sitting in converse, and there
instantly exploded with great violence.</p>

<p>Kilgariff hastened to inspect. He found the
magazine intact, so far, at least, as its contents
were concerned. There were more than a thousand
pounds of Dupont rifle powder there, secured
in wooden boxes called “monkeys,” and
there were two thousand mortar shells there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
also, each weighing twenty-four pounds, each
terribly destructive, potentially at least, and
each loaded with a heavy charge of gunpowder.
Fortunately the explosion of the gigantic shell
had not ignited the magazine. Had it done so,
neither a man nor a gun nor any trace of either
would have remained in all that circle of mortar
pits, to tell the tale of their occupancy.</p>

<p>But practically all of the earth that had constituted
the mound had been blown completely
away, and some of the timbers that had supported
it had been crushed till they had broken
and fallen in. The man who had been in charge
of the magazine was found crushed to a pulp by
the falling of the timbers.</p>

<p>When Kilgariff had fully explored, and discovered
the extent of the disaster, he swore.
Pointing to the mangled body of the man who
had been caught in the ruin, he said to Arthur
Brent:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There was never a better man than Johnny
Garrett. He had a wife and four children up
in Fauquier County. The wife is a widow
now, and the children are orphans, and Johnny
Garrett is a shapeless mass of inert human flesh,
all because of the incapacity of an engineer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
damn him! I know the fellow&mdash;” But before
continuing, Kilgariff turned to a sergeant and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Go at once to General Gracie’s headquarters,
and say that Lieutenant-colonel Kilgariff&mdash;be
sure to say <i>Lieutenant-colonel Kilgariff</i>&mdash;commanding
the mortars, asks the instant attendance
of a capable engineer and at least
twenty-five sappers and miners to repair damages
and guard against an imminent danger at
Fort Lamkin. If General Gracie cannot furnish
the assistance needed, go to General Bushrod
Johnson’s headquarters and prefer a like
request. Take a look first, and you’ll understand
how imperative it is to get help at once.
There lie a thousand pounds of rifle powder exposed
to every spark that a shell may fling into
it; and there are two thousand loaded shells to
explode. Go quickly, and don’t return without
the assistance required.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later came the sappers and
miners, armed with picks, shovels, axes, and the
other tools of their trade. At their head was
the engineer officer, Captain Harbach, who had
constructed the magazine in the first place.</p>

<p>Kilgariff was a cool, self-possessed person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
who very rarely lost his temper in any obvious
fashion. But when he saw Harbach in command,
he had difficulty in controlling himself.
Pointing to the ruined magazine, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“See one result of your carelessness and gross
ignorance.”</p>

<p>Then, pointing to the crushed and mangled
body of Johnny Garrett, he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look upon another result of your criminality
in seeking a commission in the engineers
when you perfectly knew you had no adequate
knowledge of engineering. When you were
constructing that magazine, I warned you that
your single tier of timbers under the earth was
insufficient. I reminded you of the importance
of adequately protecting the vast amount of
powder that must be stored there. I begged
you to use longer timbers for the sake of greater
elasticity, and to use three tiers of them instead
of one. Your rank at that time was older than
my own, and I could only give you advice, which
you disregarded. You now have before you
abundant evidence of your own criminal ignorance,
your own criminal neglect of plain duty,
your own criminal folly. For these I shall prefer
charges against you before this night ends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and I shall press those charges with vigour
enough to offset even the personal and political
influence that secured a commission for an incapable
like you.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff was in a towering rage, and with
the mangled body of Johnny Garrett lying there
before him for his text, he found it impossible
to restrain his speech; but to the very end, that
speech was so far under control that its tones,
at least, gave no indication of the excitement
that inspired it. If the man speaking had been
delivering a university lecture, his voice and
manner could scarcely have been under better
control.</p>

<p>When he paused, Harbach broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Be careful of your words, Captain Kilgariff&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant-colonel Kilgariff, if you please;
that is my present rank, and I’ll trouble you
to recognise it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Lieutenant-colonel Kilgariff, if
that pleases you better. Be careful of your
words. You have already spoken some for
which I shall hold you responsible.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” answered Kilgariff. “I hold
myself responsible, and I’ll answer for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
words in any way and at any time and to any
extent that you may desire. But meanwhile,
and as your superior officer, I now order you to
set to work to render that magazine safe. As
your superior officer, I shall assume authority
to direct your work and to insist that it shall
be done as I command. Let your men shovel
away all that remains of the earth mound and
send your axe-men into the timber there to cut
seventy or eighty sticks, each twenty-three feet
long and eight inches in diameter.”</p>

<p>The captain showed signs of standing on his
dignity by refusing, but Kilgariff promptly
brought him to terms by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whenever you want to call me to account, I
shall respond&mdash;I’ll do it in an hour hence, if
you choose. But for the sake of the lives of
some hundreds of men, I am going to have this
magazine securely constructed within the briefest
possible time. After that, I shall be very
much at your service. You may either set your
men at work in the way I have suggested, or
you may return to your quarters, in which case
I shall assume command of your men and do
the work myself. If you elect to return to your
quarters, I pledge you my honour as an officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that I shall not make your desertion of duty at
a critical moment the subject of an additional
charge in the court-martial proceedings that I
shall surely institute against you to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>Thus permitted, Captain Harbach retired
through the covered way, and Owen Kilgariff
assumed command of the men he had left behind
him.</p>

<p>Within two hours, the magazine was reconstructed,
and so strongly that no danger remained
of the kind that had threatened the
lives of Owen Kilgariff’s men.</p>

<p>When all was done, Kilgariff turned again to
Arthur Brent and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now let us resume our conversation.”</p>

<p>“But what about this quarrel with Captain
Harbach? He will surely challenge you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, and I shall accept. Never mind
that. He may possibly shoot me through the
head or heart or lungs. The chance of that renders
it only the more imperative that you and I
shall talk out our talk. I have much to say to
you that must be said before morning. Besides,
I must prepare my charges against Captain
Harbach. It is a duty that I owe to the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to expose the arrogant incapacity of such
men as he. Such incapacity imperils the lives
of better men, by scores and hundreds, every
day. If I can do anything to purge the service
of such incapables&mdash;men whose fathers’
or friends’ influence has secured commissions
for them to assume duties which they are utterly
incapable of discharging properly or even with
tolerable safety to the lives of other men&mdash;it
will be a greatly good achievement. Let us
talk now of something else.”</p>

<p>Then he told Arthur about the papers that
the man who called himself Campbell had intrusted
to his keeping.</p>

<p>“The matter sorely embarrasses me,” he explained.
“I don’t know what I ought to do.
Of course I am in no way bound by that fellow’s
half-spoken, half-suggested injunction not to
give the papers to Evelyn till she attains the
age of twenty-one. I completely disregard that.
But there are other things to be thought of.
My command here on the lines is losing from
twenty to thirty per cent of its personnel each
month. Nothing is more likely than that I
shall turn up among the ‘killed in action’ some
morning. If I keep the papers with me, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
are liable to fall into other and perhaps unfriendly
hands at any moment. As I have not
the remotest notion of what is recorded in them,
of course I cannot even conjecture how much
of harm that might work to Evelyn. You perfectly
understand that her welfare, her comfort,
her feelings, constitute the controlling consideration
with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand that,” said Arthur.</p>

<p>“Don’t jest, if you please,” broke in Kilgariff,
with a note of offence in his voice.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” answered Arthur, with profound
seriousness, “nothing could be farther
from my thought than jesting on a subject so
serious. I beg you to believe&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do. I believe you implicitly. But somehow
this explosion, and poor Johnny Garrett’s
needless death, and my quarrel with that reckless
incapable, Harbach, have set my nerves on
edge, so that I am querulous. Forgive me, and
let me go on. As to these papers, I want to do
that which is best for Evelyn; but I don’t know
what is best, and I can’t find out by questioning
my own mind. You see, I not only do not know
what is in the papers, but I do not even know
what circumstances gave them birth, or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
purpose of good or evil lies behind them, or
what distressing revelations they may make for
her affliction. The cold-blooded gambler, swindler,
adventurer, cheat, who gave the papers to
me is&mdash;or was, for I don’t know whether he is
now dead or alive&mdash;capable of any atrocity.
He admitted to me that he had cruelly persecuted
the girl, his daughter. It would not be
inconsistent with his character, I think, for him
to send her from his deathbed a bundle of papers
that should needlessly afflict and torture
her. He cherished quite enough of enmity to
me, I think, to make him happy in the conviction
that he had made me his unwilling and unwitting
agent in inflicting such wounds upon her
spirit.</p>

<p>“Thus I dare not give her the papers, nor
dare I withhold them, lest thereby I do her a
wrong. Counsel me, my friend. Tell me what
I should do!”</p>

<p>“Consult Dorothy,” answered Arthur. “Her
judgment in such a case will be immeasurably
wiser than yours or mine, or both combined.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That is the best solution. I
wonder I didn’t think of it before. I will act
upon it at once. I’ll send the papers to Dorothy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
by your hand, and I’ll ask you also to bear
her a letter in which I shall beg for her judgment.
That’s the end of one of my perplexities, for the
time being at least. Now let us talk of another
thing that concerns me very deeply. I am a
pretty rich man, as you know. I own some
real estate in New York City. That will probably
be confiscated when this war comes to an
end, as you and I clearly see that it must do
very soon. I own a good many stocks and
bonds and other securities, which cannot be so
easily confiscated, inasmuch as they are in possession
of my bankers, who are like drums for
tightness, and are besides my very good friends.
In addition to these things, the bulk of my fortune
is invested in Europe, where it cannot be
confiscated at all. The securities are held by
the Liverpool branch of Frazer, Trenholm, and
Company, of Charleston, for my account, so
that they are perfectly safe.</p>

<p>“Now the only relatives I have in the world,
so far as I know, are my brother and his family.
I have every reason for desiring that none
of them shall ever get a single cent from my estate.
So much on the negative side. Affirmatively,
I very earnestly desire that every dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
I have in the world shall go at my death to the
one woman I ever loved&mdash;Evelyn Byrd.</p>

<p>“It may seem to you a simple and easy thing
to arrange that, but it is not so. Any will that
I might make cutting off my relatives from the
inheritance of my property would be obstinately
contested in the courts.”</p>

<p>“But upon what grounds?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the lawyers can be trusted to find reasons
‘as plenty as blackberries.’ For one thing,
they could insist that I was a dead man long
before the date of my will.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, when I escaped from Sing Sing, there
were two other men with me. As we swam out
into the Hudson, the guards opened a vigorous
fire upon us. One of my companions was killed
outright, his face being badly mutilated by the
bullets. The other was wounded and recaptured.
He positively identified the dead man’s body as
mine. It was buried in my name, and my death
was officially recorded as a fact. So, you see, I
am officially a dead man, if ever my relatives
have occasion to prove me so. But apart from
that, my estate, when I die, will be a sufficiently
large carcass to induce a great gathering of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
buzzards about it. With half a million dollars
or more to fight over, the lawyers may be trusted
to find ample grounds for fighting.”</p>

<p>“It seems a difficult problem to solve,” said
Arthur, meditatively. “I don’t see how you can
manage it.”</p>

<p>“Such matters are easy enough when one has
friends, as I have, who may be trusted implicitly.
I have thought this matter out, and I think I
know how to handle the situation.”</p>

<p>“Tell me your plan, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Of course I wish. My first thought was to
give everything I have in the world to Evelyn
now, giving her deeds for the real estate and
absolute bills of sale for the securities. But of
course I could not do that. I could never gain
her consent to such an arrangement without first
winning her love and making her my affianced
bride.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that would be impossible?”</p>

<p>“I do not know&mdash;perhaps so. At any rate,
it is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“I confess I do not see why.”</p>

<p>“I am a convicted criminal, you know&mdash;a
fugitive from justice.”</p>

<p>“No. You are officially dead. The courts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of New York will not hold a dead man to be
a fugitive from justice. And morally you are
nothing of the kind. It was not justice, but
infamous injustice, that condemned you.”</p>

<p>“However that may be, I can never ask Evelyn
Byrd to be my wife, to share the life of a man
who might even possibly be sent back to Sing
Sing. I can never ask her to make of her children
the sons and daughters of a convicted
criminal. I will not do that. So I have thought
out another plan. My second thought was to
turn over all I have to you in trust for Evelyn.
When I am dead, she need not refuse the gift.
But there again is a difficulty. When this war
ends in the complete conquest of the South, as it
soon must, political passion at the North is well-nigh
certain to find expression in acts of wholesale
confiscation, directed against men of wealth
at the South, and men who have served as officers
in our army. They may, indeed, include all
who have served at all, even as privates. At
any rate, you are an officer of high rank, and
between you and Dorothy you are one of the
greatest plantation owners in Virginia. You
are pretty sure to be included in whatever is
done in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will not do, therefore, to make you my
trustee for Evelyn. I must have some non-combatant
to serve in that capacity, and, with
your permission, I am going to ask Dorothy to
accept the duty.”</p>

<p>“You have my permission, certainly. But I
see another danger. Suppose anything should
happen to Dorothy?&mdash;God forbid it! Suppose
she should die?”</p>

<p>“I have thought of all that,” answered Kilgariff,
“and I think I see a way out. I shall
ask Dorothy to select some friend, some woman
whom she can absolutely trust, to serve with
her as a joint trustee, giving full power to the
survivor to carry out the trust in case of the
death of either of the two. I haven’t a doubt
she knows such a woman.”</p>

<p>“She does&mdash;two of them. There is Edmonia
Bannister, one of God’s elect in character, and
there is Mrs. Baillie Pegram&mdash;she who was
Agatha Ronald. Either of them would serve
the purpose perfectly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get Dorothy to ask both of them,” responded
Kilgariff. “Then all possible contingencies
will be fully met and provided for.</p>

<p>“Now for present concerns. If I can make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Confederate taper burn for an hour, I’ll write
my letter to Dorothy, to accompany the papers,
and to ask her to serve me in this matter of the
trusteeship. I have a very capable young lawyer
under my command here as a sergeant.
Early in the morning I shall set him to work
preparing the trust conveyances. He is a rapid
worker, and will have the documents ready by
nightfall. Then I’ll send them to Wyanoke by
a courier. In the meanwhile I have Captain
Harbach on my hands. I’m afraid I must ask
you to act for me in that matter. While we
have been talking, it has occurred to me that
when I prefer my charges against Captain Harbach,
he will be placed under arrest. In that
position he would not be permitted to send me
the hostile message he threatened to-night. It
would be extremely unfair to him to place him
in such a position. I want you to write to him,
if you will, as my friend. Say to him that in
view of his expressed desire to hold me responsible
for words spoken to-night, and in order to
give him opportunity to do so without embarrassment,
I shall postpone for twenty-four hours,
or for a longer time, if for any reason he cannot
conveniently act within twenty-four hours, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
preferring of my official charges against him.
Ask him, please, to advise you of his wishes in
the matter in order that I may comply with
them.”</p>

<p>“You are a very cool hand, Kilgariff,” said
Arthur, “and your courtesy to an enemy is
extreme.”</p>

<p>“Oh, courtesy in such a case is a matter of
course. Let me say to you, now, that when I
meet Captain Harbach on the field, I shall fire
high in the air. I have no desire to kill him or
to inflict the smallest hurt upon him. I am
merely giving him the opportunity he desires to
kill me, by way of avenging himself upon me
for the severe criticisms I have made upon his
character, his conduct, and his assumption of
functions that he is incapable of discharging
with tolerable safety to other men. Let me
make this matter plainer to your mind, Arthur.
I do not at all believe in the duello. I think it
barbarous in intent and usually ridiculous in its
conduct. But I had the best of good reasons
for saying what I did to Captain Harbach, and
so I said it. What I said was exceedingly
offensive to him, and the only way he knows
of ‘vindicating’ himself is by challenging me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
a duel. It would be a gross injustice on my
part to refuse to meet him, and to do an injustice
is to commit an immorality. So, of course,
I shall meet him. As I have no desire to do
him other harm than to get him removed from
a position which he is incapable of filling with
safety to others and benefit to the service, I
shall not think of shooting at him. But I shall
give him the privilege he craves of shooting at
me. I really don’t mind, you know, under the
circumstances, except that in any case I shall
postpone his shooting at me till I can execute
the documents relating to my property.”</p>

<p>“In view of your explanation,” answered
Arthur, “I must decline to act as your friend
in this matter.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because I will have no part nor lot in a
murder. I detest duelling, as you do; I regard
it as a relic of feudalism which ought to give
place to something better in our enlightened
and law-governed time. But while it lasts, I
am forced to consent to it, however unwillingly.
I recognise the fact that the right of the individual
to make private war on his own account is
the only basis on which nations can logically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
or even sanely claim the right to make public
war. Nations are only aggregations of individuals,
and their rights are only the sum of the
rights previously possessed by the individuals
composing them. But while I feel in that way
about duelling, I can have no part in a contest
in which I know in advance that one of the contestants
is going to shoot to kill, while the other
is merely standing up to be shot at and does not
himself intend to make war at all.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Kilgariff. “I’ll get
some one else to send the letter.”</p>

<p>He summoned an orderly and directed him to
go to a neighbouring camp and ask an officer
there to call upon Lieutenant-colonel Kilgariff,
“concerning a purely personal matter, and not
at all with reference to any matter of service.”</p>

<p>The officer, a fiery little fellow, responded at
once to the summons, and he promptly wrote&mdash;spelling
it very badly&mdash;the message which Kilgariff
had asked Arthur to send.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the messenger who had
borne the note returned with it unopened. For
explanation, he said:&mdash;</p>


<p>“Captain Harbach had his head blown off in
the trenches just before daylight this morning.”</p>

<h2 class="ch">XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN’S REVELATION</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was during Arthur’s absence at Petersburg
that Evelyn began talking with Dorothy
about herself.</p>

<p>“It isn’t nice,” she said, as the two sat together
in the porch one day, “for me to have
reserves and secrets with you, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“But why not? Every one is entitled to have
reserves. Why should not you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because&mdash;well, things are different
with me. You are good to me&mdash;nobody was
ever so good to me. I am living here, and loving
you and letting you love me, and all the
time you know nothing at all about me. It
isn’t fair. I hate unfairness.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” answered Dorothy. “But this
isn’t unfair. I never asked you to tell me anything
about yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it. That’s what makes
it so mean and ugly and unfair for me to go on
in this way. Why should you be so good to me
when you don’t know anything about me?”</p>

<p>“Why, because, although I do not know your
history, <i>I know you</i>. If it is painful for you to
tell me about yourself&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be painful,” the girl answered,
with an absent, meditative look in her eyes.
But she added nothing to the sentence. She
merely caressed Dorothy’s hand. After a little
silence, she suddenly asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What’s a ‘parole,’ Dorothy?”</p>

<p>Dorothy explained, but the explanation did
not seem to satisfy.</p>

<p>“What does it mean? How much does it
include? How long does it last?”</p>

<p>Dorothy again explained. Then Evelyn
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was a parole I took. I don’t know what
or how much it bound me not to tell. I wish I
could make that out.”</p>

<p>“If you could tell me something about the
circumstances,” answered the older woman,
“perhaps I could help you to find out. But
you mustn’t tell me anything unless you wish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to tell you everything. You
see, they were trying to send me South, through
the lines somehow. They said I was to be sent
to some relatives&mdash;but I reckon that wasn’t
true. Anyhow, they wanted to send me through
the lines, and they had to get permission. So
they took me to a military man of some sort,
and he took my parole. I had to swear not to
tell anything to the enemy, and after I had
sworn that I wouldn’t, he looked very sternly
at me and told me I mustn’t forget that I had
taken an oath not to tell anything I knew.”</p>

<p>Dorothy answered without hesitation that the
parole referred only to military matters, and not
at all to things that related only to the girl herself
and her life.</p>

<p>“But, Dorothy, I didn’t know anything about
military affairs&mdash;how could I? So I reckon
they couldn’t have meant that.”</p>

<p>“They could not know what information you
might have, or what messages some one might
send through you. You may be entirely sure,
dear, that your oath meant nothing in the world
beyond that. The military authorities at the
North care nothing about your private affairs or
how much you may talk of them. Still, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
not to tell anything that you have doubts about.
You are not to wound your own conscience. I
sometimes think our own consciences are all
there is of Judgment Day. You are always to
remember that Arthur and I are perfectly satisfied
to take you for what you are, asking no
questions as to the rest. We are vain enough
to think ourselves capable of forming our own
judgment concerning the character of a girl like
you. We are not afraid of making any mistake
about that.”</p>

<p>Evelyn did not reply. She sat still, continuing
to caress Dorothy’s hand. She was thinking
in some troubled fashion, and Dorothy was
wise enough to let her go on thinking without
interruption.</p>

<p>After a while the girl suddenly dropped the
hand, arose, and went out upon the lawn. Her
mare was grazing there, and Evelyn called the
animal to her. Leaping upon the unsaddled
and unbridled mare, she started off at a gallop.
Presently she slipped off her low shoes, and in
her stocking feet stood erect upon the galloping
animal’s back. With low, almost muttered commands
she directed the mare’s course, making
her leap a fence twice, while her rider sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
stood erect, sometimes knelt, and sometimes
sat for a moment, only to rise again with
as great apparent ease as if she had been occupying
a chair.</p>

<p>Finally she brought her steed to a halt, leaped
nimbly to the ground, and resumed her slippers.
She walked rapidly back to the porch, and, with
a look of positively painful earnestness in her
face, demanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Does <i>that</i> make a difference? Does it alter
your opinion? Do you still believe in me?”</p>

<p>Her tone was so eager, so intense, that it seemed
almost angry. Dorothy only answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It makes no difference.”</p>

<p>“You know what that means? You guess
where I learned to do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And still you do not cast me out? Still you
do not command me to go away?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Why should I?”</p>

<p>“But why not? Most women of your class
and in your position would send me away.”</p>

<p>“I am perhaps not like most women of my
class and condition. At any rate, as I told you
a while ago, I <i>know you</i>, I trust you, I believe
in you. <i>You are you.</i> What else matters? Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
me tell you a little life-story. My mother was
a musician, who performed in public. Everybody
about here scorned her for that. But she
was the superior of all of them. She was a
woman of genius and strong character. She
hated shams and conventionalities, and she was
a good woman. When the war came, she set
to work nursing the wounded. She was shot to
death a little while ago, and the soldiers loved
her so that they rolled a great boulder over her
grave and carved a loving inscription upon it
with their own hands. Many of them were
killed in doing that; but whenever one fell,
another took his place. Do you think, Evelyn,
that I, her daughter, could ever scorn a good
woman like you, merely because she was or had
been an actor in a show? I tell you, Evelyn
Byrd, I <i>know</i> you, and that is quite enough
for me.”</p>

<p>“Is it enough for Cousin Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Yes, assuredly.”</p>

<p>“And for&mdash;well, for others?”</p>

<p>“If you mean Kilgariff, yes. If you mean
the conventional people, no. So you had better
never say anything about it to them.”</p>

<p>At Dorothy’s mention of Kilgariff’s name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Evelyn started as if shocked. But quickly
recovering herself, she said with passion in her
tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are the very best woman in the world,
Dorothy. I shall not long have any secrets
from you.”</p>

<p>The girl’s agitation was ungovernable. Emotionally
she had passed through a greater crisis
than she had ever known before, and her nerves
were badly shaken. Without trying to utter the
words that would not rise to her quivering lips,
she took refuge in the laboratory, where she set
to work with the impatience of one who must
open a safety valve of some kind, or suffer
collapse. Most women of her age, similarly
agitated, would have gone to their chambers
instead, and vented their feelings in paroxysms
of weeping. Evelyn Byrd was not given to
tears. Perhaps bitter experience had conquered
that feminine tendency in her, though very certainly
it had not robbed her of her intense
femininity in any other way.</p>

<p>When Dorothy joined her in the laboratory
an hour later, the girl was engaged in an operation
so delicate that the tremor of a finger,
the jarring of a sharply closed door, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a sudden breath of air would have ruined the
work.</p>

<p>“Step lightly, please,” was all that she said.
Dorothy saw that the girl had completely mastered
herself.</p>

<p>And Dorothy admired and rejoiced.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">DOROTHY’S DECISION</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">KILGARIFF had not long to wait for
Dorothy’s answer, nor was the reply
an uncertain one. It was not Dorothy’s
habit to be uncertain of her own mind,
especially where any question of right and
wrong was involved. She never hesitated to
do or advise the right as she saw it, and she
never on any account juggled with the truth or
avoided it.</p>

<p>So far as the trusteeship was concerned, she
accepted the appointment for herself and also
for Edmonia Bannister and Agatha Pegram,
both of whom were within an hour’s ride of
Wyanoke, as Agatha was staying for a time at
Edmonia’s home, Branton. Dorothy had gone
to them at once on receipt of Kilgariff’s letter,
and both had consented to accept the trust.</p>

<p>That matter out of the way, Dorothy took up
the other with that directness of mind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
made her always clear-sighted and well-nigh
unerring in judgment, at least where questions
of conduct were concerned.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I am rather surprised, Kilgariff [she wrote], and not
quite pleased with you. Can you not see that you
have no more right to let me read Evelyn’s papers
than to read them yourself? They are hers to do with
as she pleases, and neither you nor I may so much as
read a line of them without her voluntary consent.</p>

<p>Neither, I think, have you any right to withhold
them from her. They are her property, and you must
give them to her, as you would her purse, had it come
into your possession. The fact that these papers may
hurt her feelings in the reading has no bearing whatever
on the case. It is not your function to protect
her against unpleasantness by withholding from her
anything to which she has a right, whether it be
property or information or anything else. You are not
her father, or her brother, or her husband, or even a
man affianced to her&mdash;this last mainly by your own
fault, I think. It is just like a man to think that he
has a right to wrong a woman by way of protecting
her and sparing her feelings.</p>

<p>Let me tell you that Evelyn Byrd stands in need
of no such protection. Little as I know of her life-experiences,
that little is far more than you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
She has suffered; she has known wrong and oppression;
she has had to work out for herself even the
fundamental principles of morality in conduct. Her
experience has been such that it has made her wonderfully
strong, especially in the matter of endurance.
She is tender, loving, sensitive&mdash;yes, exquisitely sensitive&mdash;but
she has a self-control which amounts to
stoicism&mdash;to positive heroism, I should say, if that
word were not a badly overworked one.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have some fear that these papers
may contain things that it will be very painful for her
to read, and I strongly sympathise with your desire
to spare her. I condemn only the method you have
wished to adopt. I must not examine the papers. I
have no right, and you can give me no right, to do
that. Still less must I think of deciding whether they
are to be given to her or withheld. That is a thing
that decides itself. They are absolutely hers. You
must yourself place them in her hands. In doing so,
you can make whatever explanation or suggestions
you please, and she can act upon your suggestions or
disregard them, as shall seem best to her.</p>

<p>To do this thing properly, you must come to
Wyanoke. There seems to be no crisis impending at
Petersburg just now, and you can easily get leave for
two or three days, particularly as the distance between
Wyanoke and Petersburg is so small. In case of need,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you can return to your post quickly. A good horse
would make the journey in a very brief time. If
pressed, he could cover it in two hours, or three at
most. So come to Wyanoke with as little delay as
may be, and do your duty bravely.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Kilgariff had no need to apply for a leave of
absence. The wound in his neck had been behaving
badly for ten days past, and it was now
very angry indeed. Day by day a field-surgeon
had treated it, to no effect. So far from growing
better, it had grown steadily worse.</p>

<p>Under the night-and-day strain of his ceaseless
war work, Kilgariff had grown emaciated, and
so far enfeebled as to add greatly to the danger
threatened by the wound’s condition. On the
morning of the day which brought him Dorothy’s
letter, the surgeon had found his condition
alarming, and had said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Colonel, I have before advised you to go to
a hospital and have this wound treated. Now I
must use my authority as your medical officer
and <i>order</i> you to go at once. If I did not compel
that, the service would very soon lose a
valuable officer.”</p>

<p>“Must it be a hospital, Doctor?” asked Kilgariff.
“May I not run up to Wyanoke, instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and get my friend Doctor Brent to treat
me?”</p>

<p>“Capital! Nothing could be better. Besides,
the hospitals are full to overflowing, and
you’d get scant attention in most of them. Go
to Wyanoke by all means, but go at once. I’ll
give you a written order to go, and you can
make it the basis of your application for sick
leave. Act at once, and I’ll go myself to headquarters
to impress everybody there with the
urgency of the case and especially the necessity
for promptitude. You ought to have your
leave granted by to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>It was granted in fact earlier than that, so
that before nightfall Kilgariff set out on a
horse purchased from an officer of his acquaintance,
a horse lean almost to emaciation, but
strong, wiry, and full of spirit still. He was
an animal in which blood did indeed “tell,” a
grandson of that most enduring of racers, Red
Eye.</p>

<p>“Give a good account of yourself, old fellow,”
said Kilgariff to the animal, caressingly,
“and I promise you better rations at Wyanoke
than you have had for two months past.”</p>

<p>Whether the horse understood the promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
or not, he acted as if he did, and with a
long, swinging stride, left miles behind him
rapidly.</p>

<p>It was a little past midnight when the well-nigh
exhausted officer reached the hospitable
plantation; but before going to the house, he
aroused the negro who slept on guard at the
stables, and himself remained there till the half-sleeping
serving-man had thoroughly groomed
the animal and placed an abundance of corn
and fodder in his manger and rack.</p>

<p>Then the way-worn traveller went to the
house, entered by the never closed front door,
and made his way to a bedroom, without waking
any member of the family.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XX</h2>

<p class="pch">A MAN, A MAID, AND A HORSE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Evelyn went to the stables in
the early morning, and found a
strange horse there, she could not
learn how he came to be there, or who had
brought him. The negro man who had rubbed
down the animal under Kilgariff’s supervision
during the night had already gone to the field,
and the stable boy who was now in attendance
knew nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>The horse gently whinnied a welcome as the
girl entered, and his appearance interested her.
She bade the stable boy lead him out, so that
she might look him over, and his symmetry and
muscularity impressed her mightily.</p>

<p>“Poor beastie!” she exclaimed, upon seeing
his lean condition, “they have treated you very
badly. You haven’t had enough to eat in a
month, and you’ve been worked very hard at
that. But you are strong and brave and good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
still, just as our poor, half-starved soldiers
are. You must be a soldier’s horse.
Anyhow, you shall have a good breakfast.
Here, Ben, take this splendid fellow back to
his stall and give him ten ears of corn. Rub
him down well, and when he has finished eating,
turn him into the clover field to graze.
Poor fellow! I hope you’re going to stay with
us long enough to get sleek and strong again.”</p>

<p>As was always the case when Evelyn caressed
an animal, the horse seemed to understand and
to respond. He held out his head for a caress,
and poked his nose under her arm as if asking
to be hugged. Finally he lifted one of his
hoofs and held it out. The girl grasped the
pastern, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“So you’ve been taught to shake hands, have
you? Well, you shall show off your accomplishments
as freely as you please. How do
you do, sir? I hope you have slept well! Now
Ben has your breakfast ready, so I’ll excuse
you, and after breakfast you shall have a stroll
in a beautiful clover lot!”</p>

<p>As she finished her playful little speech and
turned her head, she was startled to see Kilgariff
standing near, looking and listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Kilgariff!” she exclaimed, in embarrassment,
“I didn’t know you were here.
You must think me a silly girl to talk in that
way with a horse.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered; “the horse seemed
to like your caressing, and as for me, I enjoyed
seeing it more than I can say.”</p>

<p>“Then you wanted to laugh at me.”</p>

<p>“By no means. I was only admiring the
gentleness and kindliness of your winning ways.
The thought that was uppermost in my mind
was that I no longer wondered at the fascination
you seem to exercise over animals. Your
manner with them is such, and your voice is
such, that they cannot help loving you. Even
a man would be helpless if you treated him so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I could never do that&mdash;at least,
well&mdash;I mean I could&mdash;” There the speech
broke down, simply because the girl, now flushing
crimson, knew not how to finish it. The
thought that had suddenly come into her mind
she would not utter, and she could think of no
other that she might substitute for it.</p>

<p>But her flushed face and embarrassment told
Kilgariff something that the girl herself did not
yet know&mdash;something that sent a thrill of gladness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
through him in the first moment, but filled
him in the next with regretful apprehension.
He saw at once that that had happened which
he had intended should never happen. Unconsciously,
or at least subconsciously, Evelyn Byrd
had come to think of him&mdash;or, more strictly
speaking, to feel toward him without thinking&mdash;in
a way that signified something more than
friendship, something quite unrecognised by herself.
Instantly the questions arose in his mind:
“What shall I do? Is it too late to prevent
this mischief, if I go away at once? If not, how
shall I avoid a further wrong? Shall I go away,
leaving her to work out her own salvation as
best she can? Or shall I abandon my purpose
and suffer myself to win her love completely?
And in that case how shall I ever atone to her
for the wrong I do her? I must in that case
deal honestly and truthfully with her, telling her
all about myself, so that she may know the
worst. Perhaps then she will be repelled and
no longer feel even friendship for a man
living under such disgrace as mine. It will
be painful for me to do that, but I must not
consider my own feelings. It is my duty to
face these circumstances in the same spirit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which I must face the dangers and hardships
of war.”</p>

<p>All this flashed through his mind in an instant,
but, without working out the problem to
a conclusion, he set himself to relieve the evident
embarrassment of the girl&mdash;an embarrassment
caused chiefly by her consciousness that
she had felt embarrassment and shown it. He
resolutely controlled himself in voice and manner
and turned the conversation into less dangerous
channels.</p>

<p>“You were startled at seeing me,” he said,
“because you did not know I was here. I
came ‘like a thief in the night.’ I got here
about midnight, after a hard ride from Petersburg.
I saw the horse groomed and fed, and
then went to the house and crept softly up the
stairs to the room I occupied when I was at
Wyanoke before. I came to let Arthur have
a look at my wound&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you wounded again?” interrupted
the girl, with a pained eagerness over which a
moment later she again flushed in shamed embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It is only that the old wound has
been behaving badly, like a petted child, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
it has been neglected. But tell me,” he quickly
added, in order to turn the conversation away
from personal themes, “tell me how the quinine
experiments get on. I’m deeply interested in
them, particularly the one with dog fennel.
Does it yield results?”</p>

<p>Evelyn was glad to have the subject thus
changed, and she went eagerly into particulars
about the laboratory work, talking rapidly, as
one is apt to do who talks to occupy time and to
shut off all reference to the thing really in mind.</p>

<p>Kilgariff’s half of the conversation was of like
kind, and it was additionally distracted from its
ostensible purpose by the fact that he was all
the time trying to work out in his own mind the
problem presented by his discovery, and to determine
what course he should pursue under
the embarrassing circumstances. All the while,
the pair were slowly walking toward the house.
As they neared it, a clock was heard within,
striking six. It reminded Evelyn of something.</p>

<p>“It is six o’clock,” she said, “and I must be
off to the hospital camp to see how my wounded
soldiers have got through the night. I make
my first visit soon in the morning now, and
Dorothy and I go together later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to a negro boy, she bade him go to
the stables and bring her mare.</p>

<p>Now it was very plainly Kilgariff’s duty to
welcome this interruption, which offered him
three hours before the nine o’clock breakfast
in which to think out his problem and decide
upon his course of action. But a momentary
impulse got the better of his discretion, so he
said:&mdash;</p>


<p>“I will ride over there with you, if I may.”</p>

<p>The girl was mistress of herself by this time,
so she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you wish. I shall be glad of
your escort, if you are strong enough to ride a
mile.”</p>

<p>She said it politely, but with a tone of cool
indifference which led Kilgariff to wish he had
not asked the privilege. Then, calling to the
negro boy, who had already started on his
errand, she bade him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bring a horse for Colonel Kilgariff; not his
own, but some other.” This was the first time
Evelyn had ever called Kilgariff by any military
title. “You see, Colonel, your splendid animal
has been badly overworked and underfed. I
have promised him a restful morning in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
clover field, and it would be too bad to disappoint
him, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly. Thank you for thinking of
that. How completely you seem to have
schooled yourself to think of dumb animals as
if they were human beings! You even assume&mdash;playfully,
of course&mdash;that the big sorrel
understood your promise about the clover
field.”</p>

<p>“Why should he not? Dumb animals understand
a great deal more than people think.
Your sorrel understood, at any rate, that I regarded
him with affection and pity. That in
itself was to him a promise of good treatment,
and just now good treatment means to him rest
in a clover field. So, while he may not have
understood the exact meaning of the words I
used, he understood my promise. I am not so
sure even about the words. Animals understand
our words oftener than we think.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean? Would you mind giving
me an illustration of your thought?”</p>

<p>“Oh, illustrations are plenty. But here are
the horses. Let us mount and be off. We can
continue our talk as we ride. Are you really
strong enough?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The man answered that he was, and the two
set off.</p>

<p>When the horses had finished their first morning
dash, Evelyn cried, “Walk,” to them and
they instantly slowed down to the indicated
gait.</p>

<p>“There!” said the girl. “That’s an illustration.
The horses perfectly understood what
I meant when I bade them walk. I am told
that cavalry horses understand every word of
command, and that, even when riderless, they
sometimes join in the evolutions and make no
mistakes.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered her companion.
“I have seen them do it often. Both in the
cavalry and in the artillery we depend far more
upon the horses’ knowledge of the evolutions
and the words of command, than upon that of
the men. They learn tactics more readily than
the men do, and, having once learned, they
never make a mistake, while men often do.”</p>

<p>“How then can you doubt that horses understand
words?”</p>

<p>“They understand words of command, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well? ‘But’ what?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know. The thought is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
new to me that it seemed for the moment a
misinterpretation of the facts&mdash;that there must
be some other explanation.”</p>

<p>“But what other explanation can there be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Indeed, I begin to see that
there is no other possible. Animals certainly
do understand <i>some</i> words. That is a fact, as
you have shown me, and one already within my
own knowledge. I see no reason to doubt that
they understand many more than we are accustomed
to think. I wish you would write that
book about them.”</p>

<p>“I am writing it,” she answered; “but I
don’t think I’ll ever let anybody see it&mdash;at
any rate, not now&mdash;not for a long time to come&mdash;maybe
not for ever.”</p>

<p>As she ended, the pair reached the invalids’
camp, and the wounded men gave Evelyn a
greeting that astonished Kilgariff quite as much
as it pleased him.</p>

<p>“The little lady! The little lady!” they
shouted, while those of them who could walk
eagerly gathered about her, with welcome in
their eyes and voices.</p>

<p>She briefly introduced Kilgariff, and together
the two went the rounds of those patients who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
were still unable to sit up. There were few of
these, but they must be the first attended to.
After that, Evelyn closely questioned each of
the others concerning the condition of his
wounds, his sleep, his digestion, and everything
else that Arthur might wish to learn in preparation
for his own rounds after breakfast. Kilgariff
was struck with the readiness Evelyn
manifested in calling each of the men by his
name, and with the minuteness of her knowledge
of the special condition and the needs of each.</p>

<p>“How do you remember it all so minutely?”
he asked, as they walked together from one side
of the camp to the other.</p>

<p>“Why, it is my duty to remember,” she
replied, in a surprised tone, as if that settled
the whole matter. And in a woman of her
character, it did.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN LIFTS A CORNER OF THE CURTAIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">DURING the return ride, Kilgariff carefully
avoided all reference to the real
purpose of his visit to Wyanoke. He
had come to dread that subject, and in his
present unsettled state of mind he feared it also.
It might at any moment bring on an emotional
crisis, and prompt him to do or say things that
must afterward cause regret. He wished to
think the matter out&mdash;the matter of his future
relations with this girl&mdash;and to determine finally
the course of conduct which this morning’s discovery
might require of him.</p>

<p>He ought to have seized upon the opportunity
for this that he had so recklessly thrown away.
He ought to have let Evelyn go to the invalid
camp alone, he remaining behind to think. But
he had missed that opportunity, and no other was
likely to come to him. Certainly no other so good
could come. He must get through the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of the papers on this day, not only because the
chances of war might compel him to return to
his post on the morrow, but because he might
very probably decide that it was his duty to
take himself out of this girl’s life, and, if that
was to be, the sooner he should quit the house
that held her the better.</p>

<p>Both Arthur and Dorothy were present to
welcome him when he and Evelyn returned to
the house, so that there was no chance then
to do his thinking. Then Arthur decided to
examine his wound before the breakfast hour;
and when he did so, he grew grave of face and
manner.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to tell you, old fellow, that I
must operate on your neck to-day. Your wound
is in a very dangerous condition indeed. It
should have been operated upon a week or ten
days ago. You shall have breakfast with us this
morning, as you’ll need all your strength. Of
course I can’t chloroform you till your breakfast
is digested, so I’ll not operate till a little
after noonday.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t give me the chloroform at all,”
answered Kilgariff.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow, the pain will be&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll stand it.”</p>

<p>“But the operation will be a very delicate
one, so near to the carotid artery that a mere
flinch from the knife might end your life at
once.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not flinch,” said the resolute young man.</p>

<p>“But what objection have you to an anæsthetic?
Your heart and lungs are in perfect
condition. There’s not the slightest danger&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Danger be hanged!” interrupted Kilgariff.
“I am not thinking of danger or caring about
it. But chloroform always leaves me helplessly
ill for many days, and I mustn’t be ill or helpless
just now. I am going back to the lines
to-morrow. One night’s sleep after your operation
will put me sufficiently in condition.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not fit for duty.”</p>

<p>“Fit or not fit, I am going.”</p>

<p>“But it will kill you.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t signify in my case, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Owen Kilgariff. You have
brooded over the unfortunate circumstances of
your life until you have grown morbid, particularly
since this wound has been sapping your
vitality. You must brace yourself up and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
a healthier view of things. If you don’t, I shall
make you. Here you are imagining yourself
disgraced at the very time when others in high
places are pressing honours upon you as the
well-earned reward of your superb conduct. It
is all nonsense, I tell you, and you must quit it;
if not for your own sake, then for the sake of
us who love you and rejoice in your splendid
manhood. Your present attitude of mind is not
to your credit. If you were not ill, it would be
positively discreditable to you.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Arthur. You are judging
me without knowing all the facts. I’ll tell you
of them after breakfast. Then, before you
operate, I must talk with Evelyn about her
papers. When that matter is disposed of, you
shall operate without an anæthetic, and I
must return to my duty on the lines.”</p>

<p>“Your duty there is done. You’ve already
taught those fellows how to use mortars effectively.
As to mere command, any other officer
will attend to that as well as you could. I must
operate upon your neck, and I will not do it
without chloroform. Indeed, even from your
own point of view, there would be nothing
gained by that, for after this operation, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
done with or without an anæsthetic, you must
not only lie abed for some days to come, but be
so braced and harnessed that you cannot turn
your head.”</p>

<p>Arthur then explained to his patient, as one
surgeon to another, the exact nature of what
it was necessary to do, and Kilgariff knew his
surgery too well not to understand how imperatively
necessary it would be for him to be kept
perfectly still, so far as motion with his head was
concerned, for a considerable period afterward.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Kilgariff responded. “Do as
you will. But first I must arrange the matter
of the papers. I’ll do that during the forenoon.
Then I shall tell Dorothy the things I
intended to tell you. There is no need that
I shall tell you, and it will be easier to tell
Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” said Arthur, satisfied that
he had carried his point. “Now we must go to
breakfast.”</p>

<p>At the table, Kilgariff observed that, apart
from the “coffee” made of parched rye, neither
Dorothy nor Evelyn took anything but fruit.
There was a cold ham on the table, and the
customary loaf of hot bread, but the two women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
partook of neither. When Kilgariff half suggested,
half asked, the reason for their abstemiousness,
Dorothy replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We Virginia women are saving for the
army every ounce of food we can. So far as
possible, we eat nothing that can be converted
into rations. Arthur compels Evelyn and me
to take a little meat and a little bread or some
potatoes for dinner. He thinks that necessary
to our health. But for the rest, we do very
well on fruits, vegetables, and other perishable
things, don’t we, Byrdie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed. For my own part, I like
it. I have had other experiences in living on a
restricted diet. Once I had nothing to eat for
three or four months except meat, so in going
without meat now I am only bringing up the
average.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“For three months or more you had no food
but meat!” he exclaimed. “No bread, no
starchy food of any kind?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever. There weren’t even
roots or grass there to be chewed. The Indians
often live in that way. Never mind that.
At another time I lived for a month in winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
almost exclusively on raw potatoes, with only
now and then a bit of salt beef.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why you did not cook the potatoes?
If it was winter, surely you had fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, plenty of it. But there was
scurvy, and raw potatoes are best for that.”</p>

<p>“Are they? I never knew that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But for eating their potatoes raw,
the people in the lumber-camps would never
survive the winter. But I don’t want to talk
about those things. I didn’t mean to. Perhaps
I’ll put them all into another book that
I’m writing just for Dorothy to read and nobody
else in all the world.”</p>

<p>She looked at Dorothy as she spoke, and
Dorothy understood. This was the first she
had heard of the proposed “book.” It was the
first reference Evelyn had made to their talk on
the day when she had given her hostess an
exhibition of bareback riding.</p>

<p>Kilgariff did not understand. Yet, taken in
connection with other things that Evelyn had
said to him during his former stay at Wyanoke,
what she now said seemed at least to lift a little
corner of the thick curtain of reserve which
shrouded her life-history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“She has lived,” he thought, “among the
wildest of wild Indians, and she has passed at
least one winter in some northern lumber-camp.
I wonder why.”</p>

<p>He was not destined as yet to get any reply
to the question in his mind.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">ALONE IN THE PORCH</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Kilgariff asked Evelyn to go
with him to the front porch, telling
her he had an important matter to
discuss with her, she showed a momentary embarrassment.
She quickly controlled it, but
not so quickly that it escaped her companion’s
recognition.</p>

<p>This troubled him at the outset. This young
woman had been until now as frank and free
with him as any child might have been. Her
present embarrassment, momentary as it was,
impressed him the more strongly because the
scene at the stables in the early morning was
still fresh in his memory, and because he had
observed that ever since that time she had uniformly
addressed him by his military title.</p>

<p>All these things added to the difficulty of his
present task, but it was his habit to meet trouble
of every kind half-way, to confront difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
with courage and not with any show of the
shrinking there might be in his mind.</p>

<p>He plunged at once into the matter in hand.
Ordinarily he would have begun by addressing
his companion as “Evelyn,” but for some reason
which he did not stop to analyse, he felt
now that he ought not to do so. Yet to address
her in any other way, after having for so long
called her by her first name, would be too
marked a suggestion of reserve. So he avoided
addressing her at all in any direct fashion.</p>

<p>“I have asked you to give me this half-hour
because I feel that I owe you and myself a
duty.”</p>

<p>He had no sooner uttered that sentence than
he felt that it was a particularly bad beginning.
In his own ears it sounded uncommonly like
the introduction to a declaration of love, and
he was annoyed with himself for his blundering.
He began again, and tried to do so more
circumspectly.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you about a matter that
touches your own happiness very closely, and
may indeed affect your entire life.”</p>

<p>Another blundering sentence! Even more
than the first it sounded to him like the preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to a formal courtship, and, realising the fact,
Kilgariff made the matter worse by manifesting
precisely such embarrassment as a lover might
feel when about to put his fortune to the touch.</p>

<p>Evelyn was quick to see his embarrassment,
though she probably had no clear idea of its
cause, and she came to his relief by saying
with a well-controlled and perfectly placid intonation:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am deeply interested. I didn’t imagine
myself a person of sufficient consequence for
anybody to have important business affairs to
discuss with me. Go on, please. What is
it?”</p>

<p>“A little while ago,” he began again, this
time approaching the subject with some directness,
“I was summoned to meet a wounded
Federal officer, who believed himself to be
dying. Probably he was right. I do not know.
However that may be, he believed that his end
was near, and I think he tried to tell the truth&mdash;an
art in which he has not had much practice
in his evil life. I had known him for some
years. He had injured me as no other man in
all the world ever did or ever can again. There
were many things that I wanted him to tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
about, and the time was very short; for I had
got at the house in which he lay wounded only
under escort of an armed force, and I knew
that my escort could not long hold the position.
By the time I had finished questioning him concerning
the matters in which I was personally
interested, the enemy was upon us in superior
force, and we were compelled to retire. Just as
I was quitting his bedside, he told me something
that surprised and shocked me&mdash;something that
deeply concerned you.”</p>

<p>“What was it, please?” asked the girl, now
pale to the lips and nervously twisting her fingers
together.</p>

<p>“I should not tell you that, I think; not now,
at any rate. It would only distress you and do
no good. Perhaps it may not have been true.”</p>

<p>“You must tell me that, or you must tell me
nothing!” exclaimed the girl, rising in a passion
of excitement, and speaking as if utterance involved
painful effort. “Understand me, Colonel
Kilgariff. I am not a child, whose feelings must
be spared by reservations and concealments. I
have not been much used to that sort of coddling,
and I will not submit to it. My life has
been such as to teach me how to endure. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
have some things, you say, which you want to
tell me&mdash;some things that have somehow grown
out of whatever it was that this man said to you.
Very well, I will not hear them, unless you can
tell me all. I will not listen to half-truths. I
must hear all of this matter, or none of it. You
say it concerns me closely. I am entitled, therefore,
to know all of it, if I am to know any of it.
You are free to tell me nothing, if you choose.
But if you tell me a part and keep back the rest,
you wrong me, and I will not submit to the
wrong. I have endured enough of that in my
life.”</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I have seemed to speak angrily
or resentfully to you. I did not mean that. Such
anger as I felt was aroused by bitter memories of
wrong, which were called up by your proposal to
put me off with a half-truth. Let me explain
myself. You are doubtless thinking that I myself
have been practising reserve and concealment
ever since I came to Wyanoke. That is
true, but it has been only because I have firmly
believed that I was oath-bound to do so; and
at any rate I have not told any half-truths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Whenever I have told anything, I have told all
of it. Another thing: I so hate concealments
that at the first moment after I learned that I
might do so, I decided to tell Dorothy everything
that I myself know about my life. I feared
to attempt that orally, lest I should grow excited
and break down; so I decided to write out
the whole story and give it to her. That is
what I meant this morning when I said I was
writing a book for Dorothy alone to read. After
she has read it, it will be hers to do with as she
pleases. It will be an honest book, telling the
whole truth and not half-truths.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff did not interrupt this passionate
speech. It revealed to him a new and stronger
side than he had imagined to exist in the nature
of the woman he loved. He rejoiced that she
felt and thought as she did, and he was not
sorry that an error of judgment on his part had
brought forth this character-revealing outburst.
He promptly told her so.</p>

<p>“You are altogether right,” he said. “I apologise
for my mistake, but, frankly, I do not
regret it. It has shown me the strength and
truthfulness of your nature with an emphasis
that altogether pleases me. I had miscalculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that strength, underestimating it. I sought to
spare your feelings, not knowing how brave you
are to endure. I know you better now, and
the knowledge is altogether pleasing.”</p>

<p>“Thank you sincerely. And you will be generous
and forgive me?”</p>

<p>As she said this, Evelyn resumed her familiar
tone and manner of almost childlike simplicity.</p>

<p>“There is nothing whatever for me to forgive,”
the man answered, in a way that carried
conviction of his perfect sincerity with it. “Let
me go on with my story.”</p>

<p>“Please do.”</p>

<p>“Just as I was hurrying to leave the wounded
man and go to my guns, which were already
bellowing, he handed me a bundle of papers.
He said that he had a daughter who must be
somewhere in the South, if she had not been
shot in passing through the lines. He begged
me to find her, if possible, and give the papers
to her. When I asked him the name of his daughter,
he answered that it was Evelyn Byrd.”</p>

<p>The girl was livid and trembling, but what
passion it was that so shook her Kilgariff could
not make out. He paused, to give her time for
recovery. She slowly rose from the bench on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
which she was sitting, and with a firm, elastic
step walked out into the grounds, where her mare
was grazing. The animal abandoned the grass,
and trotted up to her mistress to be caressed.</p>

<p>As the young woman stood there, stroking
the mare’s nose, Kilgariff thought it the
most beautiful picture he had ever looked
upon&mdash;the lithe, slender girl, who carried herself
with the grace of an athlete not overtrained,
caressing the beautiful mare and seeming to
hold mute but loving converse with a boundlessly
loyal friend.</p>

<p>“And how much it means!” he thought.
“What a nature that woman has! And what
a life hers must have been so far!”</p>

<p>Then came over him a great and loving longing
to be himself the agent of atonement to her
for all the wrong that had vexed her young life,
to make her future so bright and joyous that her
past should seem to her only a troubled dream
from which he had been privileged to waken her.
But with this longing came the bitter thought
that this could never be&mdash;that he was debarred
by his own misfortunes from the privilege of
winning or seeking to win Evelyn Byrd’s love.</p>

<p>Then arose again in his mind the questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of the early morning&mdash;the question of duty, the
question of the possibility of avoiding the wrong
he so dreaded to do. Was there yet time for
him to take himself out of Evelyn Byrd’s life?
Or was it already too late? What and how much
did her embarrassment in his presence mean?
Had she indeed already, and all unconsciously,
learned to return the great, passionate love he
felt for her? Had he blundered beyond remedy
in making himself mean so much to her? Could
he now go away and leave her out of his life
without inflicting upon her even a greater wrong
and a severer suffering than that which his
leaving would be meant to avert? If not, then
what should he do? What could he do?</p>

<p>He felt himself in a blind alley from which
there was no escape. Unhappy indeed is the
man who is confronted with a divided duty, a
problem of right and wrong which he feels himself
powerless to solve. In that hour Owen Kilgariff
was more acutely unhappy than he had
ever been, even in the darkest period of his
great calamity.</p>

<p>Presently Evelyn returned to the porch and
seated herself, quite as if nothing had occurred
out of the commonplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was the man’s name?” she asked,
with no sign of excitement or emotion of any
kind in her voice or manner.</p>

<p>“He called himself Campbell, but he told me
that it was an assumed name, and not his own.
I do not know his real name.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” said the young woman, in the
tone of one who is recalling events of the past.
“I never knew that. But go on, please. What
else did he tell you&mdash;what else that concerns
me, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. The enemy was upon us hotly,
and I had no time for further talk. Oh, yes,
he did say that he had persecuted you ‘in a way’&mdash;that
was his phrase.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what ‘in a way’ signified to him,”
said the young woman, with an intensity of
bitterness in her tone, the like of which Owen
Kilgariff had never heard in the utterance of
man or woman before.</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” Evelyn said, an instant
later, the look of agony leaving her face as suddenly
as it had appeared. “You have more to
tell me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I must make a confession of grave
fault in myself, and ask your forgiveness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
man, Campbell, your father, gave me a bundle
of papers, as I told you a little while ago, and I
have been impertinently asking myself ever
since what I ought to do with them. It did not
occur to me then that there was no question for
me to decide; that my undoubted duty was simply
to place the papers in your hands, as I now
do”&mdash;withdrawing the parcel from a pocket
and placing it in her lap. Dorothy had returned
it to him for that purpose. He continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I had not learned my lesson then. I still
thought it my duty to guard and protect you, as
one guards and protects a child. I reasoned that
those papers very probably contained information
or statements, true or false, that would
afflict you sorely, and I impertinently desired to
spare you the affliction. On the other hand, I
realised that they might contain, instead, information
of the utmost consequence to you and
calculated to bring gladness rather than sorrow
to your heart. In my perplexity I turned to
Dorothy for help. All of us who know Dorothy
do that, you know. I sent the papers to her,
explaining my perplexity concerning them. I
asked her to examine them and determine
whether or not they should be given to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I learned my first lesson. Dorothy
wrote to me, rebuking me with severity for my
presumption. She explained to me what I
ought to have understood for myself&mdash;that the
question of what it was best to do with the
papers was not mine to decide, or hers; that I
had no shadow of right to ask her to read the
documents, and she no possible right to read
them. She bade me come to Wyanoke and do
my duty like a man.</p>

<p>“That is the real reason I am here; for as to
my wound, I should have left that to take care
of itself. If it had made an end of me, so much
the better.”</p>

<p>“You have no right, I reckon, to say that,”
interrupted Evelyn, “or to think it, or to feel
it. It is a suicidal thought, and quite unworthy
of a brave man.”</p>

<p>“But my life is my own, and surely&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not altogether your own; perhaps not
chiefly. It belongs in part to those of us who&mdash;I
mean to all who care for you, all to whom
your death would bring sorrow or to whom your
living might be of benefit. Above all it belongs
to our country and our cause. You recognise
that fact in being a soldier. No; I reckon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
life is not your own to do with as you please. It
is cowardly in you to think in that way, just as
it is cowardly for one to commit suicide because
he is in trouble out of which death seems the
only way of escape, or the easiest way. So
please never let yourself think in that way
again.”</p>

<p>“I will try not to,” he replied, looking at his
lecturer with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“Now, while I had, myself, no right to say
whether or not you should read those papers,
and while it was not my privilege to protect you
against any distress they might bring to you, I
still have a good deal of apprehension lest their
reading shall needlessly wound you. I am going
to make a suggestion, therefore, which I
hope you will take in good part.”</p>

<p>“I am ashamed of myself,” answered Evelyn,
“for making you feel in that way. I am
ashamed of what I said to you&mdash;though it was
all true and necessary&mdash;and of the way in which
I said it. I wish I could explain why I did it,
why it hurt me so when you tried to conceal
something from me. My outbreak has hurt you,
and almost humiliated you, I reckon, and I don’t
like to think of you being hurt and humiliated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
It is good and generous of you to try, as you
have done, to spare me. Believe me when I tell
you that I feel it to have been so. I cannot explain,
and it vexes me that I must not. Won’t
you believe that?”</p>

<p>“I believe anything you say, and everything
you say. Indeed, it is more than belief that I
feel when you tell me anything; it is a conviction
of actual and positive knowledge. And
now I very much want you to believe me when
I say that it was not your ‘outbreak,’ as you call
it, that hurt and humiliated me. It was only my
consciousness of my own presumptuous impertinence
that hurt. I have nothing to forgive
in you; and my own fault I cannot forgive.”</p>

<p>There were tears in Evelyn’s eyes as the
strong and generous man who had been so careful
of her said this, shielding her even now by
taking all blame upon himself, just as he had
shielded her long before by keeping his own
person between her and the bullets that were
raining about them. For the moment the old
childlike simplicity came into her bearing. She
advanced, took Kilgariff’s hand, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let’s forget all about it, please. You have
always been good to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the dignity came back, and, resuming
her seat, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You were going to offer a suggestion. I
should like to hear it. I am sure it is meant for
my advantage.”</p>

<p>“It is only this: I have a haunting fear that
your father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He was not my father,” the young woman
broke in, speaking the words quite as if they
had borne no special significance. “But go on,
please.”</p>

<p>Kilgariff almost lost the thread of his thought
in his astonishment at this sudden statement.
He went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, then, the man Campbell, or whatever
his real name was. I have a haunting fear that
he has prepared those papers for the purpose of
wounding and insulting you. He was capable
of any malice, any malignity, any atrocity. He
may have put into these papers falsehoods that
you will be the better for not reading. On the
other hand, the papers may be innocent of any
such purpose, and it may even be of the utmost
importance that you should know their contents.
I venture to suggest that you yourself do what
I had no right to do; namely, ask Dorothy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
examine the packet and tell you whether or not
it is well for you to read the papers. You love
her and trust her, and her judgment is unfailing,
I might almost say infallible. This is only a
suggestion, of course. I have no right to press
it.”</p>

<p>Evelyn sat silent, holding the packet in her
hands and nervously turning it over. At last
she arose and took a few steps toward the doorway.
Then, turning about, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If it were necessary for any one to read the
papers and advise me concerning them, I should
ask <i>you</i>, Colonel Kilgariff, to stand as my friend
and counsellor in the matter. But it is not necessary.
<i>I already know what is in the papers.</i>”</p>

<p>She turned instantly and entered the house,
leaving Kilgariff alone in the porch.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">A LESSON FROM DOROTHY</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">FOR ten days after the surgical operation,
Kilgariff lay abed, his head, neck, and
shoulders held rigidly immovable by a
wooden framework devised for that purpose.
Otherwise than as regarded the wound, he
seemed perfectly well, and the wound itself
healed satisfactorily under Arthur Brent’s skilful
treatment.</p>

<p>In his constrained position it was impossible
for the wounded man to hold a book before his
eyes, and so, to relieve the tedium of his convalescence,
Dorothy read to him for several
hours each day.</p>

<p>He had vaguely hoped, without formulating
the thought, that Evelyn would render him this
service, as she had done during his first illness.
But this time she came not. Every day&mdash;until
the success of the operation was fully assured,
she inquired anxiously concerning his condition;
but at no time did she visit him, or ask to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
do so. When at last Arthur so far relaxed the
mechanical restraints that Kilgariff was able
to sit below stairs in the porch when the
weather permitted, and before a “great, bearded
fire” in the hallway if it were too cool out of
doors&mdash;for the autumn was now advanced&mdash;he
was sorely disappointed to learn that Evelyn
was no longer at Wyanoke. She had somewhat
suddenly decided to stay at Branton, for a week
or ten days, as the guest of Edmonia Bannister.</p>

<p>All this set Kilgariff thinking, and the thinking
was by no means comfortable. Did Evelyn’s
course mean indifference on her part? It
would have given him some pain to believe
that, but it would have relieved him greatly.
In that case, he might go away and never come
back, without fear of any harm to her or any
wrong-doing on his own account. In that case,
the problem that so sorely vexed him would be
completely solved.</p>

<p>Certainly that was the outcome of the matter
which he was bound to hope for. Yet the very
suggestion that such might be the end of it all
distressed him more than he had thought that
any possible solution of the difficulty could do.</p>

<p>But, in fact, Owen Kilgariff knew better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
When he recalled what had gone before, he
could not doubt the interpretation of Evelyn’s
avoidance of him, and this thought troubled
him even more than the other. It brought back
to him all the perplexities of that problem with
which he had been so hopelessly wrestling ever
since that morning at the stables.</p>

<p>What should he do? What could he do?
These questions were insistent, and he could
give no answer to them. At one moment his
old thought of a parity of disability came back
to him&mdash;the thought that as she was the daughter
of a gambling adventurer, the obligation on his
part not to seek her love or win it might not
be altogether binding. But then flashed into
his mind a memory of her words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He was not my father.”</p>

<p>That excuse, then, no longer availed him.
He could no longer&mdash;and yet, and yet. The
more he thought, the more difficult he found
it to accept the hopelessness of the case or
make up his mind to take himself out of
Evelyn’s life. Yet that, he confidently believed,
he would instantly do if he could satisfy himself
that it was not already too late for Evelyn
herself to welcome such an outcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning he opened his mind to Dorothy
on the subject, and got a moral castigation for
his pains. The gear that had restrained his
movements had been completely removed by
that time, and Kilgariff was contemplating an
almost immediate return to his post on the lines
at Petersburg.</p>

<p>“I am sorely troubled, Dorothy,” he began.
“I am going away two or three days hence,
and I wish I could go without seeing Evelyn
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can easily manage that,” answered
she, with a composure and a commonplaceness
of tone which seemed inscrutable to her companion.
She took his remark quite as a matter
of course, treating it as she might had he merely
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I should like to leave my horse here.”</p>

<p>It was not an easy conversational situation
from which to find a way out. Obviously it
was for him to make the next remark, and he
could not think what it should be. Possibly
Dorothy intended that he should be perplexed.
At any rate, she manifestly did not intend to
help him out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>Presently he found the way out of it for himself&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
only way that Dorothy would have
tolerated. That is to say, he became perfectly
frank with her.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you about that,” he said,
“if I may. I am much troubled; and while I
have no right to call upon you for any sort of
help, I feel that it may clear my mind simply
to tell you all about the matter.”</p>

<p>“I will listen with pleasure,” she said, quite
coldly.</p>

<p>Then he blurted out the whole story. He
told her&mdash;as he need not have done, for she
was not a woman for nothing&mdash;of the intensity
of his love for Evelyn; of the purpose he had
cherished to conceal his state of mind from its
object, and suffer in silence a love which he felt
himself honourably bound not to declare. Then,
with some difficulty, he told her of the scene at
the stables, and of all that had followed: he
explained how these things had bred a fear in
his mind that it was already too late for him
simply to go away, saying nothing.</p>

<p>Dorothy did not help him in the least in the
embarrassment he necessarily felt in suggesting
that perhaps the girl loved him already. On
the contrary, she sat silent during the recital;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and when it was ended she said, very coldly,
and with a touch of severity in her manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If I correctly understand you, you are of
opinion that Evelyn has fallen in love with you
without being asked. It is perhaps open to you
to cherish a belief of that kind, but is it quite
fair to the young woman concerned for you to
make a statement of that kind to me&mdash;either
directly or by implication?”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t mean that&mdash;” stammered
Kilgariff; but, instead of accepting his protest,
Dorothy mercilessly thrust him through with
another question:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Might I ask what you did mean, then?”</p>

<p>Kilgariff did not answer at once. It was
impossible to escape the relentless logic of
Dorothy’s question. It was equally impossible
to turn Dorothy by so much as a hair’s breadth
away from the truth she sought. Gentle as she
was, forbearing as it was her nature to be, she
was utterly uncompromising in her love of truth.
Moreover, in this case she was disposed to be
the more merciless in her insistence upon the
truth for the reason that Kilgariff had blunderingly
offended the dignity of her womanhood.
She held his assumption concerning Evelyn’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
state of mind and heart to be an affront to her
sex, and she was not minded to let it pass without
atonement.</p>

<p>In his masculine way, Kilgariff had many of
Dorothy’s qualities. He shared her love of
absolute truthfulness, and his courage was as
resolute as her own. He met her, therefore,
on her own ground. After a moment’s pause,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I suppose I did mean what you say; and
yet I meant it less offensively than you assume.
I frankly acknowledge my fault in speaking to
you of the matter. I had no right to do that,
even with you. I was betrayed into it by the
exceeding perplexity of the situation. I was
wrong. I ask your forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“That is better,” responded Dorothy. “I
fully believe you when you say you did not
mean to do an unmanly thing. For the rest,
I cannot see that your situation is at all a perplexing
one, except as you needlessly make it
so.”</p>

<p>“I confess I do not understand you,” replied
Kilgariff, “and yet I cannot explain my difficulty
in understanding without in effect repeating
my error and emphasising it. I should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
rejoiced to know that there is no foundation for
the fears that I have been entertaining without
any right to entertain them.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that? Would you really
rejoice to know that Evelyn Byrd’s sentiments
toward you are only those of friendship?”</p>

<p>“I believe so. It would involve a good deal
of distress to me, of course; but I count the
other consideration as supreme. It would enable
me to feel that I am privileged to go away
from here carrying my burdens on my own back
and allowing no straw’s weight to fall upon the
shoulders of the only woman in the world that
I ever loved or ever shall.”</p>

<p>Dorothy made no reply in words. Instead,
she turned her great, brown eyes full upon him
and looked at him for the space of twenty seconds,
in a way that brought a flush to his face.
Then, still making no direct reply to anything
he had uttered, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am very greatly displeased with you, Owen
Kilgariff. And I am very greatly disappointed.”</p>

<p>She rose to withdraw, but Kilgariff stopped
her, and with eager earnestness demanded:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you must. It is my right to demand
that. If you go away after saying that, and
without explaining what you mean, you will do
me a grievous injustice&mdash;and you hate injustice.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought not to have said precisely
what I did. I ought to have remembered that
you are morbid; that by your brooding you have
wrought yourself into a diseased condition of
mind. When you recover, you will understand
clearly enough that it is every honest man’s
privilege to woo where his heart directs. He
must woo honestly, of course, but the honest
wooing of a man is no wrong and no insult to
a maid. Only a morbid self-consciousness like
your own could imagine otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Then you would wish me to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I wish nothing in the case. I have said all
that I shall say. If I have spoken severely, it
has been because I have little patience with
your diseased imaginings. I don’t think I like
you very well just now.”</p>

<p>She left him to think.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN’S BOOK</p>


<p class="drop-cap16">LATE that day, came a letter and a parcel
from Evelyn to Dorothy. In the
letter the girl wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I am going to stay here at Branton for two or three
more days. That is because I do not want to be with
you while you are reading the book I have written for
you. Two or three days will be enough for the reading.
Then I am going back to Wyanoke. I have
been over to the hospital camp every morning, so I
don’t need to tell you that I am perfectly well.</p>

<p>I am sending the book by the boy who is to carry
this. Please read it within two days, so that I may
go home to Wyanoke. You know how much I love
you, so I needn’t put anything about that in this letter.
But Edmonia sends her love, and so does Mrs.
Pegram. What a dear she is! She wants me to call
her ‘Agatha,’ and I’m beginning to do so. But I would
like it better if she would let me say ‘Cousin Agatha’
instead. Somehow that seems more like what I feel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>I reckon Colonel Kilgariff will be going back to
Petersburg about now. If he hasn’t gone yet, please
give him my regards and good wishes. I hope he
won’t get himself wounded again.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dorothy faithfully delivered Evelyn’s peculiarly
reserved message to Kilgariff, whereupon
the young gentleman declared his purpose of
returning to Petersburg on the third day following,
that being the earliest return that Arthur,
as his surgeon, would permit.</p>

<p>“But I shall call at Branton to see Evelyn
first,” he added. This brought a queer look
into Dorothy’s eyes, but whether it was a look
of pleasure, or of regret, or of simple surprise,
he could not make out. “After all,” he thought,
“it doesn’t matter. I have decided to take this
affair into my own hands. And they shall be
strong hands too&mdash;not weak and irresolute, as
they have been hitherto.”</p>

<p>Before opening the manuscript, Dorothy sent
off a young negro to Branton, with a little note
to Evelyn, in which she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I shall not read a line of what you have written
until I have told you how much gratified I am that
you have wanted in this way to tell me about yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
It means much to me that you wish to tell me those
things, whatever they may be, that concern you. Another
thing I want to say to you before reading your
manuscript, and that is that no matter what it may
reveal, I shall love and cherish you just the same.
You remember what I said to you once&mdash;that I <i>know
you</i>, and that no fact or circumstance of the past can
in the least alter my feelings toward you. Be very sure
of that. Now I am going to read your manuscript.</p>

<p class="p1">She began the task at once. This is what she
read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">EVELYN’S BOOK</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">WRITTEN FOR DOROTHY AND NOBODY ELSE</p>

<p class="pc1">Preface</p>

<p class="dci4">I AM going to tell you all about myself in this
book, Dorothy&mdash;or at least all that I know.
I have wanted to tell you, ever since you began
being so good to me, and I began to love you.
I reckon you won’t like some of the things I
must tell, but I can’t help that: I must tell you
all of them anyhow, because it is right that I
should. I couldn’t tell you so long as I thought
I had sworn not to. Now that you have explained
to me about a parole, I am going to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
it. But I am going to put it in writing, because
I can tell it better that way. And besides, I
might forget some things if I tried to tell them
all with my tongue. And there are some of the
things which you may want to read about more
than once, so as to make up your mind about them.</p>

<p>Now that is all of the preface.</p>


<p class="pc2">Chapter the First</p>

<p class="dci4">I DON’T know where I was born. I reckon
it must have been somewhere in Virginia,
because, when I first saw you and heard you
speak, I felt as if I had got back home again
after a long stay away. Your voice and the
way you pronounced your words seemed so
natural to me that I think the people about me
when I was a child must have talked in the
same way. You know how quickly I fell into
the Virginia way of speaking. That was because
it all seemed so natural to me.</p>

<p>So I think I must have been born in Virginia.
At any rate I had a black mammy. I remember
her very well. She was very, very big&mdash;taller
than a tall man, and very broad across
her back. I know that, because she used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
get down on the floor and let me ride on her
back, making believe she was a horse.</p>

<p>Her name was Juliet. When I read about
Romeo and Juliet years afterward, I remember
laughing at Shakespeare for not knowing that
Juliet was big and strong and black. That
must have been while I was still a little child,
or I should have understood better. Besides,
I remember where I was when I read the play,
and I know I was only a little child when I was
there.</p>

<p>That is all I remember about my life in Virginia,
if it was in Virginia that I was born.
There must have been other people besides
Juliet around me at that time, but I do not remember
anything about them. I cannot recall
what kind of a house we lived in; but I do
remember playing on a beautiful lawn under
big trees. And I recollect that there were a
great many squirrels there, just as there are in
the trees in your Wyanoke grounds. It is
strange, isn’t it, that I should remember the
squirrels and not the people? But perhaps
that is because I used to feed the squirrels and
play with them, and one day one of them bit me
painfully. I must have been treating it badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Second</p>

<p class="dci5">THE next thing that I remember is being
in a large city somewhere. We lived in
a hotel. My father and mother were with me,
and a great many men came to see my father,
and talked with him about business things. I
didn’t know then, but I think now that my
father was engaged in some kind of speculation,
and these men had something to do with it. At
any rate, my father was a speculator always, and
I think he sometimes gambled, for I heard some
one say afterward that he would “gamble on anything
from the turn of a card to the wrecking
of a railroad.” That was long after, however,
and I didn’t understand what the words meant.
I reckon I don’t quite understand even now,
but at any rate I know that my father was
always busy; that he had something to do with
a water-works, and some railroads, and some
steamboats, and some stores, and many other
things. Sometimes he seemed to have more
money than he knew what to do with, and
sometimes he was very poor. My mother used
to cry a good deal, though I reckon my father
never treated her badly, as I never heard him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
scold her in any way. When she would cry,
it seemed to distress him terribly. He would
go away, sometimes for days at a time, and
when he came back he would put a large pile
of money in her lap and beg her to cheer up
and believe in him.</p>

<p>I didn’t know at that time what my father’s
name was. Everybody called him “Jack,” and
that was all I heard. I was a very little girl
at that time, and if I ever heard his full name
in those days, I can’t remember the fact. But
I loved him very much. He was always very
good to me, and he laughed a great deal in a
way that I liked. I didn’t like to see my
mother cry so much, so I loved my father far
better than I did my mother.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Third</p>

<p class="dci5">THERE seems to be a gap in my memory
at this point. I know I must have been
a very little girl at the time I have spoken of&mdash;only
four or five years old at most. The next
thing I remember is that we landed from a big
ship that had big sails, and a good many people
and a cow on the top, and a great many pumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>My father wasn’t with us, and as I can’t remember
thinking about his absence, I suppose
I hadn’t seen him for a long time. There were
only my mother and my grandmother, and me&mdash;or
should I say “I”?&mdash;I don’t know.</p>

<p>I reckon I must have been six or seven years
old then.</p>

<p>When the ship landed, a man named Campbell
met us at the landing. His name wasn’t really
Campbell, as I have since found out, but he was
called by that name. I remembered him in a
vague way. He had been one of those who
came to see my father when we lived in the
hotel. My father called him his partner, and
once, when my father suddenly became very
poor, he called Campbell a swindler and a
scoundrel, and said he had ruined all of us.
I didn’t know at that time what the words
“swindler” and “scoundrel” meant, but from
the way in which my father spoke them I
knew they were something very bad; so I hated
Campbell.</p>

<p>That was the only time I ever heard my father
and mother quarrel. I remember it, because
it frightened me terribly. They seemed to be
quarrelling about Campbell. When my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
called him by bad names, my mother, as I now
understand, seemed to defend him, and that
made my father angrier than ever.</p>

<p>So, when Campbell met us at the ship and
seemed so glad to see my mother, I thought of
my father, and I hated Campbell. I remembered
the names my father used to call him,
though I still didn’t know what the words
meant. So, when Campbell tried to pet me, I
resented it in my childish fashion, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’re a swindler, you know, and a scoundrel.
I don’t want you to talk to me.”</p>

<p>He pretended to laugh, but I know now that
he was very angry with me.</p>

<p>Some time after that (I don’t know how long,
but it was probably not long) my mother and
Campbell got married, out in a Western city
somewhere, and went away for a time, leaving
me with my grandmother.</p>

<p>I couldn’t understand it, and I said so. Just
before they started away on a train, my mother
told me in the railroad station that Campbell
was my new papa, and that I must love him
very much. I remember what I said in reply.
I asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is my father dead?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk about that, dear,” said my mother,
trying to hush me. But I asked the question
again:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is my father dead?”</p>

<p>“No, dear, but your father has gone away,
and we’ll never see him again. So you mustn’t
think about him.”</p>

<p>“Then you have two husbands at once,” I
answered. “How can you have two husbands
at once?”</p>

<p>She tried to explain it by telling me that my
father was no longer her husband, but I couldn’t
understand. And, Dorothy, I don’t understand
it now. Of course I know now that my parents
had been divorced, but I don’t and can’t understand
how a woman who has been a man’s wife
can make up her mind to be any other man’s
wife so long as her first husband lives. I suppose
I was a very uncompromising little girl at
that time, and I was very apt to say what I
thought about things without any flinching from
ugly truths. So, when they went on trying to
hush me by telling me that Campbell was now
my papa, I flew into a great rage. I took hold
of my hair and tore out great locks of it. I
tried to tear off my clothes, and all the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
I was saying things that caused all the passengers
in the station to gather about us; some
of them laughing, and some looking on very
solemnly, as I shrieked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I won’t have him for my new papa! He’s
a swindler and a scoundrel! My papa told you
so a long time ago! I hate him, and I’m going
to hate you now and for ever, amen!”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what the words meant, but they
had been strongly impressed upon my memory
by the vehemence with which my father had
uttered them long before. As for the final
phrase, with the “amen” at the end of it, I
had heard it in church, and had somehow got
the impression that it was some kind of highly
exalted curse.</p>

<p>Campbell was angry almost beyond control.
I think he would have liked to kill me, and I
think he would have done so but for all those
people standing by while I so bitterly vituperated
him. As he could not do that, he
said angrily to my grandmother:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take her away! Take her away quick!”</p>

<p>My grandmother then threw my little cloak
over my head to suppress my voice, and hurried
me into a carriage. To some woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
drove with us to our hotel, my grandmother said,
thinking I would not understand:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m seriously afraid the child is right.”</p>

<p>I understood, and I liked my grandmother
better than ever, after that.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Fourth</p>

<p class="dci5">WHEN Campbell and my mother came back
from their journey, he seemed determined
to placate me. He brought me many toys.
Among them was a big doll that could open
and shut its eyes and cry. I did not utter a
word of thanks. I didn’t feel any gratitude or
pleasure. I took the toys, and dealt with them
in my own way. A very bad man had been
hanged in the town a little while before, and I
had heard the matter talked of a great deal.
So I got a string, tied it around the doll’s neck,
and proceeded to hang it to the limb of a tree
in our yard. The rest of the toys I threw into
a little stream near our house. When all was
done, I returned to the house and marched into
the drawing-room, where a good many people
had gathered to greet my mother and her new
husband. Everybody grew silent when I entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the room. They had all heard of the
scene I had made at the railroad station, and
they now held their breath to wait for what I
might say or do.</p>

<p>I walked straight up to Campbell and said,
as loudly as I could:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have hanged that doll you gave me, and
I’ve pitched the other things into the creek.
You’re a swindler and a scoundrel, and I hate
you.”</p>

<p>There was a great commotion, but I gave no
heed to that or anything else. Before anybody
could think of what was best to be done, I
turned about and marched out of the room with
all the dignity I could muster.</p>

<p>I am not sorry or ashamed over these things,
Dorothy. I think I was right, and I am glad I
did as I did. But that was the beginning of
trouble for me.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Fifth</p>

<p class="dci5">WE were living then in Campbell’s big
house, in some Western city. It was
a very fine and costly place, I reckon. A little
bedroom had been furnished for me, opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
off the suite of rooms that Campbell and my
mother were to occupy. If it had been in anybody’s
house but Campbell’s, I should have
loved that beautiful bedroom. As it was, I
hated it with all my soul. My grandmother
and I had gone to the house on the day before
my mother’s return, and that night&mdash;the night
before they came back&mdash;I was put to bed in
my room. I lay there with my eyes wide open
till I knew that everybody else in the house was
asleep. Then I slipped out of bed, crept downstairs,
and out over the wet grass to a kennel
that had been assigned to my own big Saint
Bernard dog, Prince. I crept in, and slept beside
the big, shaggy fellow till morning, when
a great outcry was raised because I was missing
from my room.</p>

<p>All the servants said my behaviour was due
to my loneliness in the great house. That
wasn’t so. I was never lonely in my life, because
whenever I began to feel lonely I always
called the fairy people to me, and they were
glad to come. I had created them in my own
fancy, and they loved me very much. But I
wouldn’t invite them into that room or that house.
So I went to Prince, as my only other friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>But after my outbreak in the drawing-room,
a servant was directed to take me to my room
and lock me in. I sat there in the window-seat
for a long time, wondering what would
be done to me next, and wondering how I
was to escape from my prison; for I fully
intended to escape, even if I should find no
other way than by leaping out of my second-story
window.</p>

<p>After a while, the door was opened and
Campbell came in. I could see that he was
very angry, and I was particularly glad of that,
because it showed me that my words had hurt
his feelings very much. That was what I
intended.</p>

<p>He had a little switch in his hand, and, as he
stood over me, glowering in order to scare me
before speaking, I saw it. I instantly seized a
heavy hair-brush that a maid kept to brush my
thick hair with.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t strike me.” That was all I
said.</p>

<p>“I’m going to teach you better manners,”
he began.</p>

<p>“You’d better not try,” I answered. “If
you strike me, <i>I’ll kill you</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>I meant that, Dorothy; and when, a minute
later, he struck me with the switch, meaning to
give me a dozen blows, I reckon, I leaped at
him&mdash;slender, frail little child that I was&mdash;and
with all the strength my baby arm had, I
struck him full in the face with the edge of the
heavy brush. I fully intended that the blow
should brain him. It only broke his nose, but
it made him groan with pain.</p>

<p>Now I want to be absolutely truthful with
you, Dorothy. You mustn’t excuse my attempt
to kill that man, on the ground that I was a
mere child and did not know what I was doing.
I was a mere child, of course, but I knew what
I was doing or trying to do, and I felt no sort
of regret afterward, when he had to send for a
surgeon to mend his nose bone, and had to lie
abed for a fortnight with a fever. Or, rather,
I did feel regret; but it was only regret over
the fact that I had done so little. I had meant
to kill him, and I was very sorry that I had not
succeeded. That is the fact, and you must
know it. And more than that, it is the fact,
that even now, when I am a grown-up woman
and have thought out a code of morals for myself,
I still cannot feel any regret over what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
did, except that I didn’t succeed in doing more.
I would do now what I tried to do then, if the
situation could repeat itself.</p>

<p>I don’t know what you will think about all
this. But I don’t want you to think about it
without knowing that I am not sorry for it, but
justify it in my own mind. I am trying to be
perfectly honest and truthful with you; so that
if you love me at all after reading my book, it
shall be with full knowledge of all that is worst
in me. If you don’t love me after you know
all, I shall go away quickly and not pain you
with my presence.</p>

<p>Now, Dorothy, I want you to stop reading
this book and put it away for a few hours&mdash;long
enough for you to think about what I have
written, and make up your mind about this part
of my story. After that, you can read the rest
of it and make up your mind about that.</p>

<p class="p1">Dorothy complied with this request. She
laid the book aside for two hours. Then she
came back to the reading; but before beginning
again, she scribbled this paragraph at the

<p class="pbq p1">I have taken two hours of recess from the reading.
There was no need of that. My whole soul sympathises

<p class="pch">MORE OF EVELYN’S BOOK</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Dorothy resumed her reading,
her sympathies were keenly alive
and responsive. She had thought
out the matter, and reached a definite conclusion
which entirely satisfied her conscience.</p>

<p>“Ordinarily,” she thought, “I should think
it excessively wrong to sympathise with a desire
to kill, or even to tolerate it in my mind. But
I see clearly that in that matter, as in most
others, there are questions of circumstance to
be considered. Every human being has a right
to kill in self-defence. Both law and morals
recognise that. In a state of nature, I suppose,
every man is constantly at war on his own
private account, and he has an entire right to
make war in defence of himself and his family.
The only reason he hasn’t that right in a state
of civilisation is that society protects him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
return for his giving up his right to make private
war. But when society, as represented by
the state, refuses to protect him, or when
the state cannot protect him, he has his
right of private war in full force again.</p>

<p>“That was Evelyn’s case. She was a helpless
child in the hands of a brute. There was no
way in which she could secure protection from
any wrong he might see fit to do her. So,
when he came with evident intent to do her
harm, she had a perfect right, I think, to fight
for herself in any way she could. No human
being is under obligation to submit to an insult
or a blow.</p>

<p>“Besides&mdash;well, never mind that. I was
thinking of the way in which we all recognise
killing in war as entirely legitimate. But that
is a large subject, which I haven’t thought out
to the end as yet. For the present purpose it
is enough to know that Evelyn had a right to
make such war as she could&mdash;poor little mite
of a girl that she was&mdash;upon that brutal man.
I should have done the same under like circumstances.
Yes; I heartily approve her conduct.”</p>

<p>With that, Dorothy turned again to the manuscript,
and read what follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Sixth</p>

<p class="dci4">I HAD hurt Campbell very badly indeed. I
had shattered the bridge of his nose to bits,
and there was a great commotion in the house&mdash;sending
for a lot of doctors, and all that. My
mother thought of nothing but staunching the
blood and getting the doctors there. The servants
were all excited and running about bringing
hot water and towels and so forth, so that
no attention was paid to me.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the confusion. I put on
a little cloak and my sun-bonnet, and quietly
slipped out through one of the back doors into
the grounds. Then I called my dog, Prince, to
go with me, and in the gloaming&mdash;for it was
nearly nightfall&mdash;he and I waded across the
little creek that ran at the back of the place.
The house stood at the extreme edge of the
little city, and there was no town on the farther
side of the creek. So Prince and I went on
down the road, meeting nobody.</p>

<p>My grandmother had left the town that day,
to go back to her home somewhere in the East,
so I made up my mind to walk toward the East
every day till I should come to the village where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
she lived. I knew the name of the village, but
I didn’t know what State it was in or how far
away it might be; still, I hoped to find it after
a while, by inquiring of people. But I feared
a search would be made for me, so I decided
not to reveal myself by making inquiries till I
should be far away from the town where Campbell
and my mother lived.</p>

<p>After walking along the road for what seemed
to me many hours, Prince and I climbed over a
fence and went far into the woods. There we
hid ourselves in a clump of pawpaw bushes and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>When we woke, there was a heavy rain falling,
and we were very, very hungry. So we set
out to find a road somewhere, so that we might
come to a house and ask for something to eat.
But there didn’t seem to be any end to the
woods. We went on and on and on, without
coming out anywhere. I ate two pawpaws that
I found on the bushes, but poor Prince couldn’t
eat pawpaws, so he had to go starving.</p>

<p>At last we grew so tired that we stopped to
rest, and I fell asleep. When I waked, it was
still raining hard, and my clothing was very
wet, and I was very cold, and it was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
night again. So I told Prince we must hurry,
and find a house before it should grow dark.</p>

<p>But when I tried to hurry, my feet wouldn’t
do as I wanted them to. My knees seemed to
give way under me, and I grew very hot. My
head ached for the first time in my life, and my
eyes bulged so that I couldn’t see straight.
Finally I seemed to forget who I was, or where
I was trying to go. Then I went to sleep.</p>

<p>When I waked, I was lying in that bedroom
in Campbell’s house, and a nurse was sitting by
me. I tried to get up, but couldn’t. So I went
off to sleep again, and when I waked once more,
I understood that I was very ill and had been so
for a considerable time. I asked somebody if
Prince had been fed, and learned that he had.
I never asked another question about the matter,
and to this day I do not know how long I
lay unconscious in the woods, or who found me
there, or how, or anything about it.</p>

<p>I must have taken a good while to get well;
for I remember how every morning I planned
to run away again the following night, and how
before night came I found myself still unable to
do anything but lie in bed and take my medicine.</p>

<p>When at last I was able to sit in a rocking-chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
for an hour or two at a time, my mother
undertook to chide me a little about my conduct.
I reckon she didn’t accomplish much,
because she began at the wrong end of the
affair.</p>

<p>“You hurt Mr. Campbell very badly,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Did I? I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“You are a very wicked girl.”</p>

<p>To that statement I made no reply. I accepted
it as true, but I was not sorry for it.
Instead, I asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is he going to die?”</p>

<p>“No. But he is very ill. That is to say, he
is suffering a great deal of pain.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“You terrible child! What am I to do with
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’m going to run away again
as soon as I can. You’d better let me stay
runaway.”</p>

<p>Small as I was, I vaguely understood that my
mother’s first care was for the man Campbell,
and that so far as I was concerned, she cared
only for the trouble she expected me to give her.
If she had loved me a little, if she had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
me into her lap and seemed a little bit sorry for
me, I reckon she might have had an easier time
with me. But she did nothing of that kind.
Instead of that, she managed to make me feel
that she regarded me somewhat in the light of
a criminal for whom she was responsible.</p>

<p>She set a watch upon me day and night, keeping
me practically a prisoner in my own room.
That was because I had made the mistake of
telling her I meant to run away again. But even
as a prisoner, I might have been tractable if she
had spoken kindly and lovingly to me when she
visited my room, which she did two or three
times a day. Instead of that, she always looked
at me as one might at a desperate criminal, and
she talked to me of nothing but what she called
my wickedness, saying that it would break her
heart.</p>

<p>Even when I got well enough to go out, I was
kept in my room until at last the doctor positively
ordered that I should be sent out of doors
every day. When that was done, a servant
maid whom I particularly disliked was sent with
me, under orders never to let me out of her
sight for a moment. I was as completely a
prisoner out of doors as in the house. But out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of doors I could sit down at the root of a tree,
shut my eyes, and bring my fairy friends to me.
In that way I managed to make myself happy
for little spells, as I could not do in my room,
for I simply would not ask the fairy people to
go to that horrible place.</p>

<p>But this relief was soon taken from me. The
servant who watched me, seeing me sit with my
eyes shut, reported that I spent all the time out
of doors in sleep. She was directed by Campbell,
who had assumed control of my affairs, not
to let me sit down at all out of doors.</p>

<p>When this was reported to me, I simply refused
to go out of doors again, and I stuck to
that resolution in spite of all commands and
threats. My health soon showed the results of
confinement, and the doctor, who was a friendly
sort of man, but strongly prejudiced by the bad
things he had been told about me, did all he
could to persuade me to go out. I absolutely
refused. Then my health grew still worse, and
finally the doctor insisted that I should be sent
away somewhere.</p>

<p>Before that could be arranged, something else
happened to affect me. I’ll tell you about that
in another chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Seventh</p>

<p class="dci5">THE servant who acted as my keeper suddenly
changed her manner toward me
about this time. She talked with me in a
friendly way, and she sang to me, trying to
teach me to sing with her. I refused to do
that, because I was unhappy and did not feel
like singing. But I rather liked to hear her
sing, as she had a pretty good voice. Still, in
my childish way, I distrusted the girl. I could
not understand why she had been so unkind to
me before, if her present kindness was sincere.</p>

<p>She begged me to go out of doors with her,
and promised of her own accord that I should
sit down and shut my eyes whenever I pleased.
After a day or two, I so far yielded as to go out
with her for an hour and have a romp with
Prince. But I resolutely refused, then or on
succeeding days, to sit down and shut my eyes,
and call the fairy people. I felt, somehow, that
it would compromise my dignity to accept surreptitiously
and from a servant a privilege which
was forbidden to me by the servant’s master and
mistress.</p>

<p>Still, I went out for a little while every day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
The girl called our outings “larks,” which puzzled
me a good deal, as I knew there were no
larks in the town. Finally, one brilliant moonlight
night, as I sat looking out of the window,
the girl, as if moved by some sudden impulse,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let’s go out for a lark in the moonlight.
I’ll put your cloak and bonnet on you, and it
will do you good.”</p>

<p>I consented, and we quickly made ourselves
ready. Just after we had got out of doors, I
noticed that the girl had a satchel in her hand;
and when I questioned her about it, she said
that she wanted to make believe that we were
two ladies going to travel; “and ladies always
have satchels when they travel,” she explained.</p>

<p>We wandered about for a little while, and
then the girl led the way to the extreme corner
of the grounds, a spot which could not be seen
from the house even in the daytime, because of
the trees. There was a little gate there, which
opened into a road, and the girl proposed that
we should pass through it for some reason which
I cannot now remember.</p>

<p>We had walked only a little way beyond the
gate when we came to a carriage which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
standing still, with a big man on the box and a
tall, slender man standing by the open door of
the vehicle. When this man turned his face
toward me in the moonlight, I recognised him.
He was my father! He stooped and put his
arms about me tenderly, laughing a little, as he
always had done when talking with me, but
stopping the laugh every moment or two to kiss
me. Then he told me to get into the carriage
so that we might go for a drive. When I had
got in, he gave the servant girl some money,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you keep your mouth shut and know
nothing, there’ll be another hundred for you.
I shall know if you talk, and if you do there’ll
be no money for you. I’ll send the money, if
you don’t talk, in two weeks, in care of the
bank.”</p>

<p>Then we drove away in the moonlight, and I
found presently that the girl had put the satchel
into the carriage. I learned the next morning
that it contained some of my clothes, and my
combs and brushes.</p>

<p>We travelled in the carriage for several hours,
and then got on board a railroad train, which
took us to Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Eighth</p>

<p class="dci5">WE hadn’t been many days in Chicago
when one morning about daybreak my
father waked me and said that Campbell was
after me, so that we must hurry. My father
had bought me a lot of things in Chicago&mdash;clothes
of many kinds, and a few books. I
reckon he didn’t know much about clothes or
books&mdash;poor papa&mdash;for all the clothes were
red, and the books, as I now know, were intended
for much older people than I was. But
he said that red was the prettiest colour, and as
for the books, the man that sold them had told
him that they were “standard works.” I remember
that one of them was called <i>Burke’s Works</i>,
and another <i>Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire</i>. I simply couldn’t like <i>Burke’s
Works</i>, but I reckon that was only because I
didn’t know what Mr. Burke was talking about.
I reckon I didn’t understand Gibbon very well,
but I liked him, because he told some good
stories, and because his sentences were musical.
I liked <i>Macaulay’s Miscellanies</i> for the same
reason, and I liked <i>Macaulay’s History</i> because
it was so simple that I could understand it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Best of all, I liked <i>Rasselas</i>, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>,
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and <i>The British Drama</i>,
and Shakespeare&mdash;at least, in parts. I liked
to read about Parolles, and the way he was
tricked and his cowardice exposed. I identified
him with Campbell, and rejoiced when he got
into trouble. I suppose that was wicked, but
I’m telling you all my thoughts, Dorothy, so
that you may know the whole truth about me
and not be deceived. I liked Falstaff, too.</p>

<p>I liked <i>Rasselas</i>, because in his happy valley
there was no man like Campbell. And I liked
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> for the same reason. Somehow
I liked to live with him on his island, because I
knew that if Campbell should land there, Robinson
Crusoe would shoot him.</p>

<p>But above all, I liked the <i>British Drama</i>,
because it opened a new and larger life to me
than any that I had ever known.</p>

<p>When my father waked me up on that morning,
I hurriedly packed my books and clothes
into a trunk. There were very few underclothes,
for my father knew nothing about such
things, but there were many red dresses and red
cloaks and red hats. And there were two fur
coats&mdash;big enough for a grown woman to wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>We got on board a train and travelled all day.
Then we took another train and travelled all
night, till we came to the end of the railroad.
Then we got into a cart and travelled three or
four days into the woods.</p>

<p>Finally we came to a camp in the woods,
where my father seemed to be master of everything
and everybody. There were Indians there
and half-breeds, and Canadian lumber-men, for
it was a lumber-camp. There was a Great Lake
there, and many little lakes not far away. I
reckon the Great Lake was Lake Superior, but
I don’t know for certain.</p>

<p>There were no women in the camp except
squaws and half-breeds. They were pretty good
people, but very dirty, so I could not live with
them. My father made the men build a little
log house for him and me, and he made them
hew a bath-tub for me out of a big log. Then
he hired a half-breed girl to heat water every
day and fill the tub for me to bathe in. As for
himself, he jumped into the lake every morning,
even when he had to make the men cut a hole
in the ice for his use.</p>

<p>I liked the lumber-camp life because I was
free there, and because there were big fires at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
night, like bonfires. One of them was just
before my door, and my father made an Indian
boy keep it blazing all night for me, so that I
might see the light of it whenever I waked.
I used to sit by it and read my books, even
when the snow was deep on the ground; for by
turning first one side and then the other to the
fire I could keep warm. And the Canadians and
the half-breeds and the Indians used to squat
on the ground near me and beg me to read the
books aloud to them. As they all spoke French,
and understood no word of English, of course
they didn’t understand what I read to them,
but they liked to hear me read, and it was
sometimes hard to drive them away to their
beds, even when midnight came.</p>

<p>They taught me French during the year I
lived among them. You tell me it is very bad
French, and I reckon it is; but it was all they
knew: they did their best, and I reckon that is
all that anybody can do. At any rate, they
were kind to me, and they taught me all the
ways of the birds and the animals. I tried to
teach them to be kind to the birds and the
animals, after I began to understand the wild
creatures; but the camp people never would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
learn that. Their only idea of an animal or a
bird was to eat its flesh and sell its skin.</p>

<p>There was a young priest there who knew
better, and he ought to have loved the birds
and animals. But he used to talk about God’s
having given man dominion over the beasts and
the birds, and that doctrine perverted his mind,
I think. He killed a pretty little chipmunk, one
day, to get its skin to stuff. That chipmunk was
my friend. I had taught it to climb up into my
lap and eat out of my hand. He persuaded it
to climb into his lap, and then he betrayed its
confidence and killed it. I was very angry with
him. I picked up an ox-whip and struck him
with it twice. I was only a little girl, but I had
grown strong in the outdoor life of the camp,
and it doesn’t take much strength to make an
ox-whip hurt.</p>

<p>There was great commotion in the camp when
this occurred. The people there were very religious
in their way, but they seemed to me to
worship the priest rather than God. They
didn’t mind sinning as much as they pleased,
because they knew that the priest would forgive
their sins on easy terms; but they thought that
my act in striking the priest with the ox-whip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
was a peculiarly heinous crime. Perhaps it was,
but I can’t even yet so look upon it. They
regarded him as a “man of God”; but if
he was so, why did he deceive the poor little
chipmunk, and persuade it to trust him, and
then kill it cruelly? Dorothy, I am not a bit
sorry, even now, that I chastised him with the
ox-whip.</p>

<p>[“Neither am I,” wrote Dorothy in the margin
of the manuscript.]</p>

<p>But the occurrence created a great disturbance
in the camp, and so my father had to take
me away, for fear that the lumber-men would
kill me. Curious, isn’t it, that while they were
so religious as to feel in that way about the
priest, who after all was only a man, they were
yet so wicked that they were ready to commit
murder in revenge? But those people were
very ignorant and very superstitious. They
thought some terrible calamity would fall upon
them if I were permitted to remain in the camp.
I think they cared more about that than they
did about the priest. Even those who had been
kind to me, teaching me to ride bareback and
to shoot and to fish and to make baskets, and all
the rest of it, turned against me; so that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
father had to stand by me with his pistols
cocked and ready in his hand, till he could get
me out of the camp.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Ninth</p>

<p class="dci5">FROM that camp my father took me way up
to Hudson’s Bay. We travelled over the
snow on sledges drawn by dogs, and I learned
to know the dogs as nobody else did. They
were savage creatures, and would bite anybody
who came near them. But somehow they never
bit me. They didn’t like to be petted, but they
let me pet them. I don’t know why this was
so, but it was so.</p>

<p>We did not remain long at Hudson’s Bay&mdash;only
a few weeks. After that, we went somewhere&mdash;I
don’t know where it was&mdash;where
the whale-men came ashore and rendered out
the blubber they had got out at sea.</p>

<p>You must remember that my father had many
interests. He owned part of the lumber-camp
we had stayed in, he had a fur trade at Hudson’s
Bay, and he had an interest in some
whaling-ships. Wherever we went, my father
seemed to be at home and to be master of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
men about him. I admired him greatly, and
loved him very much. I wondered how my
mother could have left him and married Campbell.
I am wondering over that even yet.</p>

<p>It was while we were at Hudson’s Bay that I
began to understand something about my father.
He sat down with me one day (he didn’t often
sit down for more than a few minutes at a time,
but on this occasion he sat with me for nearly
half a day) and explained things to me.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you some things, little girl,”
he said, “and I want you to try to understand
them. Above all, I want you to remember them.
You know sometimes I have a great deal of
money, and sometimes I have none at all. That
is because my business is a risky one. Sometimes
I make a great deal of money out of it,
and sometimes I lose a great deal.</p>

<p>“Now, when your mother left me, I made up
my mind to provide well for her and you, so that
no matter what else should happen, you and she
might never come to want. You see, I still loved
your mother. I insured my life for a large sum,
and as I had plenty of money then, I paid for
the insurance cash down. You don’t understand
about such things, and it isn’t necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
you should. But by insuring my life and paying
cash for the insurance, I made it certain that
whenever I should die, a rich insurance company
would pay you a big sum of money; I had
purposely made it payable to you and not to
your mother, because I knew you would take
care of your mother, while she could never take
care of anybody or anything. I also bought
some bonds and stocks and put them in your
name, and placed them in a bank in New York.</p>

<p>“Now, I want you to pay close attention and
try to understand what I tell you. Here are
some papers that I want you to keep always by
you&mdash;always in your little satchel. Always have
them by you when you go to bed, and always
lock them up by day. Take them with you
wherever you go.</p>

<p>“This one is my will. It gives you everything
that I may happen to own when I die.” With
that, he handed me the papers.</p>

<p>“This one is the life-insurance policy. When
I die, you, or whoever is acting for you, will
have to present that to the life-insurance company,
together with doctors’ certificates that I
am really dead. Then the company will pay
you the money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>“This one is a list of the securities&mdash;the
bonds and stocks&mdash;that I have deposited in
your name in the Chemical Bank of New York.
You see, it is signed by the cashier of that bank.
It is a receipt for the bonds and stocks. So you
must keep it very carefully.</p>

<p>“Now, another thing you must remember: you
can’t draw the money on my life-insurance policy
until I die; but you can get these bonds and
stocks at any time that you please, merely by
presenting the receipt and asking for them. So
long as you are a little girl under age, you
couldn’t do this for yourself. Somebody must
do it for you. You must be very careful whom
you select for that purpose.”</p>

<p>Then he gave me the names and addresses of
several gentlemen, who, he said, were his friends
and honest men, and advised me to apply to
them to act for me if I ever had occasion to do
anything of the kind. Then he went on to say:</p>

<p>“The scoundrel, Campbell, knows that you
own all this, besides some houses and lands
(here’s a memorandum of them) which I have
deeded to you. In the hope of getting hold of
your property, he, as your stepfather, has had
himself appointed your guardian. It is a shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
that the courts allow that, but he owns a judge or
two, and he has managed to get it done. That
is why he is following us and trying to get hold
of you. He doesn’t know what your property
is, or where, and he thinks you will have these
papers. So, if he can get hold of you, he thinks
he can get hold of the property also. If I can
manage to get you to New York, I’ll take the
papers out of your hands and place them in
charge of some men there whom I can trust.
But as I may fail in that, and as something
may happen to me, I want you to have the
papers.</p>

<p>“I am pretty well off just now, but my business
is very uncertain. When I die, I may be very
rich, or I may ‘go broke’ any day between now
and then. That is why I have put this property
into your hands while I have it. I am a reckless
fellow. I ‘take the very longest chances’
sometimes in my business enterprises. Sometimes
I suddenly lose pretty nearly everything
I have in the world, and I might die just at
such a time. So I have provided for you in
any case.</p>

<p>“If I can get to New York with you, I am
going to hide you completely from that man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Campbell. There is an excellent gentlewoman
there in whose hands I intend to put you. She
is a woman to be trusted, and she is rather poor,
so she will be glad to take charge of you and
keep you out of Campbell’s way, damn him!
Pardon me, dear! I didn’t mean to swear in
your presence. I only mean that I can give
that lady plenty of money, and she can take
you wherever she thinks you will be safe.”</p>

<p>“But I had much rather stay with you, Father,”
I answered, with tears in my eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. And God knows,” he said,
“that I had rather have you with me. But
everything is a gamble with me. I have many
enemies, child, and some one of them may make
an end of me any day. The other way will be
safest for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for myself,” I answered. “I
only care for you, and to be with you. I’ll take
the risks, and if any of your enemies ever makes
an end of you, as you say, I want to be there to
wreak vengeance. You know I can shoot as
straight as any man alive, whether with a pistol
or a rifle or a shot-gun.”</p>

<p>“You dear child!” he responded, “I know
all that. And that is why I want to house you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
safely. You have it in you to be as reckless as
your dad is, and I don’t intend that you shall
have occasion or opportunity.”</p>

<p>How I did love my father! I don’t believe
he was ever bad, Dorothy, though they said
he was. People who liked him used to say he
was “uncommonly quick on trigger”; people
who hated him called him a desperado. I call
him my father, and I love his memory, for he
is dead now, as you will hear later.</p>

<p>But I was anxious to remember all that he
had told me, and to make no mistake about it.
I had taught myself how to write, during my
stay at the lumber-camp and on Hudson’s Bay, so
I got some old blank books from the agency,
books which had been partly written in by a
clerk who made his lines so hairlike that I could
write all over them and yet make my writing
quite legible. In these I wrote all that my
father had said, just as he had said it, meaning
to commit it to memory if I had got it right.
When it was done, I took it to him and he read
it. He laughed when he came to the swear
word, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You might have omitted that. Still, I’m
glad you didn’t, because it shows how bravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
truthful you are, and I love that in you better
than anything else.”</p>

<p>I have always remembered that, Dorothy. I
don’t know how far those who have left us
know what we do; but I always think that if
my father knows, he will be glad to have me
perfectly truthful, and I love him so much that
I would make any sacrifice to make him glad.</p>

<p>After he had read over what I had written,
and had corrected a word here and there, I set
to work to commit it to memory, so that I should
never forget a line or a word of it. That is how
it comes about that I am able to report it all to
you exactly.</p>

<p>Now I know you are tired, so I am going to
begin a new chapter, and you can rest as long
as you like before reading it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XXVI</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN’S BOOK, CONTINUED</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT was Dorothy’s habit when reading a book
to stop for an hour now and then, and
devote that space to careful thinking.
She explained her practice to Arthur one day,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If a book be interesting, it is apt to dominate
the mind, and sometimes to mislead the
judgment. I think it well to suspend the reading
now and then, and give myself a chance to
shake off the glamour of the narrative, and to
think out for myself what it means and to what
it tends. One must do that, indeed, if one
doesn’t want to surrender himself or herself
completely to the dominance of an author’s
thought, but chooses instead to do his or her
own thinking.”</p>

<p>So Dorothy took an hour or two for thinking
before going on with the reading of Evelyn’s
book. Evelyn knew her habit, and she had
recognised it by changing chapters at this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>When Dorothy took up the pages again, she
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Tenth</p>

<p class="dci5">WE stayed a long time among the whaling
people, and they taught me many things.
I learned from them how to tie all sorts of
knots, and how to catch sea fish, and how to
row, and best of all, how to sail a boat.</p>

<p>They were a curious kind of men. They
swore all the time, in almost every sentence.
But their swearing didn’t mean anything, and
so it didn’t shock me in the least. They were
not at all angry when they swore. They swore,
I think, merely because they hadn’t any adjectives
with which to express their thoughts.
They called me a “damned nice gal,” and they
meant it for a compliment. In the same way,
they spoke of a tangle in a fish-line as “a
damned ugly snarl,” or of a fish as “a damned
big catch.” I suppose one might cure them of
swearing by teaching them some adjectives.
But nobody ever took the trouble to do that.</p>

<p>They were good fellows&mdash;strong and brave,
and wonderfully enduring. When I went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
fishing with them, and the tide was out on our
return, so that we couldn’t come up to a pier,
one of them would jump overboard in the mud,
pick me up, swing me to his broad shoulders,
and carry me ashore dry-shod, without seeming
to think anything of it.</p>

<p>One day we had a storm while I was out in a
fishing-boat. As soon as it came on, all the boats
came to the side of ours, though it was dangerous
to do so, just to make sure of my safety.
The boat I was in was swamped, and I was
spilled overboard. But I was no sooner in the
angry sea than I was grabbed by the arms of
a stout young fellow who gallantly bore me
toward a little sloop that lay at hand. A mast
broke off and fell. It hit the poor fellow, and,
finding himself unable to do any more, he called
to a comrade to take me, and he sank in the
water and was drowned. He didn’t seem to
care for himself at all, but only to save me, and
all the rest of them seemed to think that that
was a matter of course. I got my father to
give me some money, and I hired a stone-cutter
to put up a monument over the poor fellow’s
grave; for we recovered his body, with both
arms broken by the blow from the falling mast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
There are lots of heroes, Dorothy, who are
never engaged in wars.</p>

<p>At last my father took me away from the
whaling town, and we went to New York in a
little schooner. It took us a long time, because
the winds were adverse, but we got there after
a while, and went to a hotel. It was the Astor
House, I think, and it had a beautiful little park
nearly in front of it. I don’t think that is of
any consequence, but, you see, I am trying to
tell you everything. You can skip anything
you don’t care for.</p>

<p>[“I’m not skipping anything,” wrote Dorothy
in the margin.]</p>

<p>As soon as we were settled at the hotel, my
father sent for the gentlewoman he had spoken
about, and placed me in her care. Then something
happened that I never understood. Before
my father could take the papers from me
and place them in the hands of the gentleman
he intended to leave them with, he was somehow
compelled to leave the city. He went
away suddenly after midnight, and I never saw
him again. I still kept the papers after he left
New York so suddenly.</p>

<p>The lady was greatly excited when my father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
note came to her, saying that he had gone away,
and she seemed to fear some danger for me.
So, between midnight and morning, she packed
our things, and we went to a boarding-house
away up-town. Even there she didn’t feel
safe, and so, within a day or so, we went on
board a canal boat, and went up the river, and
then along the canal for many days.</p>

<p>I asked the lady (Mrs. Dennison was her
name) why we hadn’t taken a railroad train
instead, so as to travel faster. She answered:
“They were watching all the trains, dear, and
would have caught you if we had tried to take
one. They didn’t think of canal boats, because
nobody travels by them in these days.”</p>

<p>After we had travelled by canal boat for several
days (a week or more, I think), we left the
boat at a very little village, and went away
across country to a little house in a sparsely
settled district. There Mrs. Dennison and I
lived quite alone for more than a year. It was
a very happy year, except that I couldn’t see
my father, and except for another thing. Mrs.
Dennison made me wear a boy’s clothes and
call myself by a false name, “Charlie Dennison.”
She did that to prevent Campbell from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
finding me. I suppose it really didn’t matter
much, but somehow I didn’t like the thought
of wearing a disguise and going by an assumed
name.</p>

<p>Of course, as a boy, I couldn’t go much with
the few girls there were in the neighbourhood,
and at the same time, being in fact a girl, I
couldn’t go out and associate with the boys.
So my only companion was Mrs. Dennison.
We lived together in a tiny bit of a house that
belonged to her, and she was the only real
teacher I ever had. I reckon she didn’t know
much about books. At any rate, she didn’t
care about them. But she let me read mine
as much as I pleased, and she taught me how
to do all sorts of household things. Especially
she taught me to do needlework, and as I used
to do it in our little porch in the summertime,
the boys thought it strange for a boy to use a
needle, so they used to call me “Miss Charlotte”
and gibe and jeer at me a good deal.
But I didn’t mind, particularly as there was a
woodland near our house, so that I could see
a great deal of my birds and squirrels. It was
then, too, that I made acquaintance with many
insects and bugs&mdash;pinch-bugs, ants, yellow-jackets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and a lot more. You can’t imagine
how greatly interested I became in studying
the ways of these creatures. They all have
characters of their own; and when one really
becomes acquainted with them, they are vastly
more interesting than commonplace people are.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Eleventh</p>

<p class="dci6">AFTER we had lived for more than a year
in the little cottage, Mrs. Dennison one
day told me we must go away quickly, and we
left within an hour. She let me put my girl’s
clothes on before we started.</p>

<p>“They have found out that you are disguised
as a boy,” she explained, “and when they set
out to find us again, they’ll probably look for
a lady and a boy. So, by wearing girl’s clothes
again, you’ll have a better chance to escape
their clutches.”</p>

<p>I was getting to be a pretty big girl by that
time, and so I had been ashamed of wearing
boy’s clothes for some time past. But when I
put on my gowns again, they made me still
more ashamed, because they were so short.</p>

<p>So, as soon as we got to a place where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
could stop for a few days, Mrs. Dennison sent
for two dressmakers to fashion some new gowns
for me, and I really looked quite like another
person when I put them on.</p>

<p>That must have been about four years ago.
According to what I was afterward told, I was
then thirteen years old. I know now that I
was fifteen. But I’ll tell you all about that
further on.</p>

<p>All this while, Mrs. Dennison was receiving
money from my father at regular intervals, and
there was plenty of it. But it never came
directly from my father. It came from a bank,
with a very formal note saying that the money
was sent “by order of Mr. Jackson Byrd,” and
asking Mrs. Dennison to sign and return a receipt
for it. My father sent us no letters and
no messages. This troubled me very much
when I got to thinking about it. And that
made me very unhappy, for I loved my father
dearly, and I remembered how happy I had been
with him. But after thinking more about it, I
saw that he hadn’t forgotten his little girl and
hadn’t quit caring about her, because if he had,
the money wouldn’t have come so regularly.</p>

<p>Still, that troubled me more than ever, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
it must mean that my father was in some kind of
difficulty, that he could not send any letters to
us. I learned afterward that this was so, but
Mrs. Dennison would never tell me anything
about it.</p>

<p>We were moving about a good deal at this
time, generally starting suddenly&mdash;sometimes
so suddenly as to leave many of our things behind.
But I always carried the little satchel
that contained the papers my father had given
me.</p>

<p>At last, one day when we left the train at Chicago
and entered a carriage to drive to a little
hotel that we were to live at, a man came to the
carriage door and handed Mrs. Dennison a paper.
He said something which I did not understand,
and Mrs. Dennison kissed me and got out of
the carriage. The man got in, and ordered the
carriage to drive away with us, leaving Mrs.
Dennison standing there on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>I was terribly scared, and wanted to jump
out. I tried to open the doors, but the man had
placed his hands on the two latches, so that I
couldn’t move them. I felt like shrieking, but
I decided that it was best to control myself, keep
my wits about me, and be ready to deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the situation wisely, as soon as I should find out
what it really was. So, summoning all my self-control,
I entered into conversation with the man
who sat on the front seat opposite me.</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me,” I asked, “why you
have kidnapped me in this fashion?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t kidnapping, young lady, an’ it ain’t
anything else irregular. You see, I had a warrant.
I’m a court officer, an’ I does what the
court orders an’ nothin’ else.”</p>

<p>“Then a court ordered you to seize me?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Ya’as ’m,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But on what ground?”</p>

<p>“‘Tain’t my business to know that, Miss, an’
as a matter of fac’ I don’t know it. All I know
is, I was give a warrant an’ tole to serve it, an’
bring you to the court. Don’t you worry about
a-payin’ of the cabman. I’ll ten’ to all that.”</p>

<p>“But what do they want with me in court?”
I asked insistently.</p>

<p>“Dunno, Miss.”</p>

<p>“But who is it that wants me?”</p>

<p>“Dunno, Miss, only the warrant head said,
‘Campbell vee ess Byrd and Dennison.’”</p>

<p>“But what right have they to bother me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
this way? Am I not a free person? Haven’t I
a right&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dunno, Miss, ’tain’t my business to know.
But I suppose you’re a gal under age, and I
suppose gals under age ain’t got no rights in
pertic’lar, leastways in opposition to their gardeens.”</p>

<p>By this time, we had arrived at the courthouse,
and I was taken before the judge. I remember
thinking that if I should displease him
in any way, he could order me hanged. I know
better now, but I thought so then; so I made up
my mind to be very nice to the judge.</p>

<p>Campbell was there, and he had a lawyer with
him. The lawyer told the judge that Campbell
was&mdash;something in Latin&mdash;<i>loco parentis</i>, I think
it was. Anyhow, it meant stepfather, or something
like that. He said the courts in his State
had made him my guardian; that I possessed
valuable property; that I had been abducted
by my father, who was a dissolute person, now
serving out a sentence in the State’s prison
for some crime. He gave the judge a lot of
papers to prove all this.</p>

<p>I was so shocked and distressed to hear
that my father was in prison, that for a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
I couldn’t speak. At last I controlled myself
and said to the judge:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I love my father. If he has been sent to
prison, it was that man”&mdash;pointing to Campbell&mdash;“who
got him sent there. My father is good
and kind, and I love him. Campbell is wicked
and cruel, and I hate him. Look at his flat
nose! That’s where I smashed it with a heavy
hair-brush when he tried to whip me for telling
the truth about him. I don’t want to go with
him. I want to go back to Mrs. Dennison, till
my father can come after me. Please, Judge,
let me do that.”</p>

<p>The judge asked Campbell’s lawyer how old
I was, and he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thirteen years old, your Honour.”</p>

<p>Then the judge said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“She seems older. If she were fourteen, I
should be bound by the law to let her choose
her own guardian for so long at least as she
shall remain in Illinois. But as the papers in
the case seem to show that her age is only thirteen,
I am bound to recognise the guardianship
established by the courts of another State. I
must remand the girl to the custody of her
guardian, Mr. Campbell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, seeing in how desperate a strait I was,
I summoned all my courage. I rose to my feet
and faced the judge. I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“But, please, Mr. Judge, this isn’t fair. That
man Campbell hates me, and I hate him. Isn’t
it better to send me to somebody else? Besides
that, he has a lawyer, and I haven’t one. Can’t
I hire a lawyer to speak for me? I’ve got two
dollars in my pocketbook to pay him with.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed when I said that. You
see, I had no idea what the price of lawyers
was. But just then an old gentleman arose and
said to the judge:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If it please the court, I will appear as counsel
for this persecuted girl. I have listened to
these proceedings with indignation and horror.
It is perfectly clear to my mind that this is a
case of kidnapping under the forms of the law.”</p>

<p>There the judge interrupted him, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The court will permit no reflections upon its
proceedings.”</p>

<p>Then my lawyer answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have cast no reflections upon the court.
My challenge is to the integrity and good faith
of this man, Campbell. I do not know the facts
that lie behind this proceeding. I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
ask the court for an adjournment, in order to
find them out. It is obvious that this young
girl&mdash;helpless and friendless here&mdash;looks not
only unwillingly, but with positive horror, upon
the prospect of being placed again in Campbell’s
charge. Morally, and I think legally, she
has a right to be heard in that behalf, to have
the facts competently explored and fully presented
to the court. To that end, I ask that
the matter be adjourned for one week, and that
the young girl be paroled, in the meanwhile,
in the custody of her counsel.”</p>

<p>Then the dear old gentleman, whom everybody
seemed to regard with special reverence,
took his seat by my side, and held my hand in
his. Campbell’s lawyer made a speech to the
judge, and when he had finished, the judge said
that my lawyer’s request was denied. He explained
the matter in a way that I did not understand.
It seemed to anger the old lawyer who
had taken my case. He rose and said, as nearly
as I can remember:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Honour’s denial of my motion is a
denial of justice. This young girl, my client, is
a minor child, utterly defenceless here except
in so far as I have volunteered my services to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
defend her. But she is an American citizen, and
as such is entitled to be heard in her own behalf.
In this court she cannot get a hearing, for the
reason that this court has corruptly prejudged
the case, as it corruptly prejudges every case
in which money or influence can be brought to
bear.”</p>

<p>By this time the judge was pounding with his
mallet, and the whole court-room was in an uproar.
But, raising his voice, my dear old lawyer
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If justice were done, you, sir, would be
dragged from the bench that you dishonour by
sitting upon it. Oh, I know, you can send me
to jail for speaking these truths in your presence.
I trust you will try that. If, by any
martyrdom of mine, I can bring the corruption
of such judges as you are to the knowledge and
attention of this community, I shall feel that my
work is well done. In the meantime I shall set
another to secure for this helpless girl a writ
of habeas corpus which shall get for her, in
another and more righteous court, the fair hearing
which you insolently and criminally deny to
her here. Now send me to jail in punishment
of the immeasurable contempt I feel for a court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
where justice is betrayed for money, and where
human rights are bartered away for a price.”</p>

<p>The judge was very angry, and a lot of men
surrounded my old lawyer. But what happened
afterward I have never known. For no sooner
was I put in Campbell’s charge than I was hurried
to a train, and the next morning I heard
him say to one of the men he had with him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We are out of Illinois now; we’ve beaten
that writ of habeas corpus.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to me and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you care for your own comfort, you will
recognise me as your guardian, and behave
yourself accordingly.”</p>

<p>I reckon you must be tired reading by this
time, Dorothy, so you are to take a rest here,
and I’ll write the remainder of my story in other
chapters. I’m afraid I’m making my story tedious;
but I’ve fully made up my mind to tell it
all, because I don’t know what you will care for
in it, and what will seem unimportant to you.
If I try to shorten it by leaving out anything, the
thing I leave out may happen to be precisely the
thing that would change your opinion of me. I
want to deal absolutely honestly with you; so
I am telling you everything I remember.</p>

<h2 class="ch">XXVII</h2>

<p class="pch">KILGARIFF’S PERPLEXITY</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">DURING the two days that Dorothy had
thus far given to the reading of Evelyn’s
book, Kilgariff had been chafing
impatiently. He wanted to go back to Petersburg
and active duty, and he wanted, before
doing so, to ride over to Branton and “talk it
out with Evelyn,” as he formulated his thoughts
in his own mind.</p>

<p>He could do neither, for the reason that his
wound began to trouble him again, and Arthur
Brent, upon examining it, condemned him to
spend another week or ten days in the house.</p>

<p>So far as “talking it out with Evelyn” was
concerned, it was perhaps fortunate that he was
compelled to submit to an enforced delay. For
he really did not know what he was to say to
Evelyn; and the more he thought about the
matter, the more he did not know.</p>

<p>The question was indeed a very perplexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
one. How should he even begin the proposed
conversation? Should he begin by abruptly
telling Evelyn that he loved her, but that there
were reasons why he did not want her to give
him love in return? That was not the way in
which a woman had a right to expect to be
wooed. It would be a direct affront to her
womanly and maidenly pride, which she would
promptly, and bitterly, and quite properly, resent.
Moreover, by arousing her anger and
resentment, it would utterly defeat his purpose,
which was to find out his own duty by
finding out how far Evelyn had already learned
to think of him as a possible lover.</p>

<p>Should he, then, ask her that question, in
her own singularly direct and truthful way of
dealing?</p>

<p>That would be to affront and wound her by
the assumption that she had given her love
unasked.</p>

<p>Should he begin by explaining to her the
circumstances which prompted him to shrink
from wooing her, and then offer her his love
if she wanted it?</p>

<p>Nothing could be more preposterous than that.</p>

<p>Should he simply pay her his addresses, ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
her for her love, and then, if she should give it,
proceed to explain to her the reasons why she
should not have permitted herself to love such
a man as he?</p>

<p>That question also promptly answered itself in
the negative, with emphasis.</p>

<p>What, then, should he do?</p>

<p>Clearly it would be better to await Evelyn’s
return to Wyanoke, and trust to good luck to
open some possible way. At any rate, he might
there approach the subject in indirect ways;
while if he could have ridden over to Branton
for the express purpose of having a conference
with her, no such indirection would have been
possible. His very going to her there would
have been a declaration of some purpose which
he must promptly explain.</p>

<p>Obviously, therefore, it was better that he
should not go to Branton, but should await
such opportunity as good fortune might give
him after Evelyn’s return to Wyanoke. But
that necessity postponed the outcome, and Kilgariff
was in a mood to be impatient of delay,
particularly as every hour consciously intensified
his own love, and rendered him less and less
capable of saying nay to his passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>With her woman’s quickness of perception,
Dorothy shrewdly guessed what was going on
in his mind, and she rejoiced in it. But she
made no reference to the matter, even in the
most remotely indirect way. She simply went
about her tasks with a pleased and amused smile
on her face.</p>

<p class="pch">EVELYN’S BOOK, CONCLUDED</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN Dorothy took up Evelyn’s
manuscript again, it was nine o’clock
in the evening of the second day,
and, moved by her eagerness to follow the story,
even more than by her conscientious desire to
finish it before the author’s return on the morrow,
she read late into the night. But she had
sent Evelyn a note in the late afternoon, in
which she had written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">My Evelyn is not to fail in her promise to come
back to me to-morrow. I have not yet completed the
reading of the manuscript, though I hope to do so
to-night, if a late vigil shall enable me to accomplish
that purpose. I have asked Arthur to let me sleep in
the nursery to-night, if I finish the reading in time to
sleep at all. So I can sit up as late as I please without
fear of disturbing him. Poor fellow, he is working too
hard and thinking too hard even for his magnificent
strength.</p>

<p>But whether I finish your manuscript to-night or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
not, Evelyn dear, I have read enough of it to know
that your life-story only confirms the judgment I had
formed of your character, and draws you nearer to my
sympathies. So come home in the morning, and don’t
disappoint me.</p></div>

<p class="p1">When she took up the manuscript again, this
is what she read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Twelfth</p>

<p class="dci5">WE travelled by the railroad as far as it
went. Then we had to get into a big
wagon, drawn by six mules.</p>

<p>The country we passed through was wild, and
quite uninhabited, I think. At any rate, we saw
no houses, and no people except now and then
a little party of Indians. There were no roads,
only dim trails, and there were no bridges, so
that it sometimes took us three or four days to
get across a river.</p>

<p>We carried all our provisions in the wagon,
and when we stopped for the night we cooked
our suppers by great big fires, built out of doors.
It was usually about nightfall when we pitched
our camp, and so long as our way lay through
the woods, I used to lie awake for hours every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
night, looking up and watching the light from
the camp-fire as it played hide and seek among
the great trees. When at last we got out of the
woods and began travelling over a vast prairie,
the camping was far less pleasant, particularly
when a norther blew, making it bitter cold.
Still, I insisted on sleeping out of doors, although
Campbell had fitted up a cosy little bedroom for
me in the big wagon. That was because it was
Campbell’s wagon. Out of doors I felt a sort of
freedom, while if I even looked into the wagon
I realised that I was that man’s prisoner.</p>

<p>He was trying to be good to me then. That
is to say, he was trying to make me think him
kind and to make me like him. Among other
things, he gave me a horse to ride on. He had
intended at first that I should travel in the
wagon, but I would not do that. I preferred
to walk, instead. So, after the second day,
when we met a party of Indians, he bought a
horse of them and gave it to me to ride. It was
a vicious brute, bent upon breaking my neck,
but I knew how to ride, and within a day or
two I had taught the animal to like me a little,
and to obey me altogether. I had no saddle,
of course, but I never did like a saddle, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
don’t, even now, as you know. So I got one of
the men to strap a blanket on my horse’s back
with a surcingle, and I rode upon that.</p>

<p>The men who drove our mules were very
rough fellows, but they soon got to liking me.
I suppose that was because I knew how to ride
and wasn’t afraid of anything. However that
may be, they seemed to like me. They would
do their best to make me comfortable, giving me
the best they could get to eat&mdash;birds, squirrels,
and the like&mdash;and always making for me a
pallet of dry grass or leaves to sleep upon.</p>

<p>Finally, one evening, when Campbell had
gone away from the camp for some purpose or
other, one of the rough men came to me and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Little Missy”&mdash;that is what they always
called me&mdash;“little Missy, you don’t like Campbell
an’ you want to get away from him. Now
he’s pretty quick on trigger, but I’m a bit
quicker’n he is, an’ anyhow I’ll take the
chances for you. Ef you say the word, I’ll
pick a quarrel with him an’ kill him in fair
fight. Then my pards an’ me’ll take you to
some civilised town an’ leave you there, so’s
you kin git back to your friends. Only say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
word, an’ I’ll git him ready for his funeral afore
mornin’.”</p>

<p>Of course this horrified me, particularly the
indifference with which the man thought of
murder. I told him he must never think of
doing anything of the kind, and asked him to
promise me.</p>

<p>“It’s jest as you says, little Missy,” he answered.
“Only me an’ my pards wants you to
know how ready we are to do you any little
favour like that ef you want it done.”</p>

<p>That night I couldn’t sleep. I lay all night
looking up at the stars and thinking with horror
of the light way in which this man had proposed
to commit a murder for me. Then the thought
came to me that I had myself tried to kill
Campbell once with a hair-brush, and for a while
I felt that after all I was no better than these
murderous men. But, after thinking the thing
out, I saw that the two cases were quite different.
I had hit Campbell in self-defence, and I
could not even yet feel sorry that I had wanted
to kill him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Thirteenth</p>

<p class="dci5">CAMPBELL was living, at that time, in a
little town somewhere in Texas, and we
got there after two or three weeks.</p>

<p>It was a dismal-looking place. All the houses
were built of rough boards, set upon end, and
most of them were saloons. Campbell’s house
was like all the rest, and when I asked my
mother why he lived in so small a house, and
what he had done with the fine one that I
remembered, she told me he had lost most of
his money.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after I got to his house,
Campbell took me before a sort of judge who
had two pistols and a knife in his belt. Campbell
told the judge that he wanted to adopt me
as his daughter. When the judge asked him
how old I was, he said I was thirteen, and then
the judge said that my consent to his adoption
of me was not necessary.</p>

<p>The reason he said that was because I had told
him that I didn’t want to be Campbell’s daughter.
The judge signed the papers, and told me that
Campbell was my father now, and that I must
obey him in everything. Campbell told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
my name would hereafter be Evelyn Byrd
Campbell. I supposed then that he was telling
the truth.</p>

<p>When he got home that evening, he had been
drinking heavily, and he seemed particularly
happy. He told my mother that he had “fixed
things,” so that they wouldn’t be poor any
longer. He said he was going to buy a big ranch
and raise horses.</p>

<p>That night when I went to my bed, I found that
somebody had broken into my closet and taken
the satchel in which I kept my papers. When
I raised an alarm, Campbell told me he had taken
the papers and put them in a secure place, lest
I should lose them. He said he was my father
now, and that it was his duty to take care of my
property.</p>

<p>I was terribly angry&mdash;so angry that if the
teamster who had offered to kill Campbell for
me had been there, I think I should have asked
him to get my papers for me, although I knew
that he would probably kill Campbell in doing
so. But the teamster was gone from the town,
and I was helpless.</p>

<p>Campbell and my mother did not get on
together very well at this time. They never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
exactly quarrelled, at least in my presence, but
I think that was because my mother regarded
quarrelling as vulgar. She was a refined woman,
or had been. She seemed now to be very unhappy,
and I was sorry for her, though I could
not love her. I never had loved her since she
had married Campbell while her real husband,
my father, was still living. One day I asked her
if she didn’t think she had made a mistake in
doing that, and if she didn’t think it wrong and
wicked and vulgar for a woman to have two
husbands alive at the same time. She rebuked
me severely for what she called my insolence,
and bade me never mention that subject again.
I never did&mdash;to her.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Fourteenth</p>

<p class="dci5">VERY soon after this, Campbell bought a
large ranch, as he said he would do, and we
moved away from the town to live on the ranch.</p>

<p>I know now that he bought it with my
money. When he had me made his daughter,
and got hold of my papers, the law somehow
allowed him to sell the stocks and bonds my
father had given me, and he did so. I never
knew this until a very little time ago&mdash;since I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
have been at Wyanoke. I’ll tell you about that
in the proper place.</p>

<p>There were many horses on the ranch, and I
spent nearly all my time riding them bareback
and teaching them little tricks. It was the only
thing I could do to amuse myself; for I did not
like to be with my mother, and I hated the very
sight of Campbell.</p>

<p>I had already learned to ride standing on the
back of a horse, and I decided to learn all about
that sort of riding. I enjoyed the danger involved
in it, for one thing, especially when I
learned to ride two horses at once in that way.
But I did not practise these things for the sake
of the excitement alone. I had a plan to carry
out. I had determined to run away with the
first circus that should come to that part of the
country. I thought that if I could learn to be
a really good bareback rider, the circus people
would be glad to take me with them, and in
that way I should get away from Campbell.</p>

<p>So I practised my riding every day, growing
steadily surer of myself and more expert. I
practised jumping through hoops, too&mdash;forward
and backward&mdash;and standing on my
hands on horseback, and throwing somersaults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>At last a circus came to the town twelve
miles from the ranch, and Campbell offered to
take me to see it. He was in one of his placative
moods just then, and thought he would
please me by this. But I declined the invitation.
I did that because I meant to run away
and join that circus, and I wanted him to think
I cared nothing about a circus, so that he
shouldn’t look for me among the show people.
I still had the horse he had bought from the
Indians and given to me, so that I could take
that without being accused of horse-stealing.
The horse was a tough, wiry fellow, who liked
nothing so much as to run with all his might.
I think he could have travelled at half-speed for
twenty or thirty miles without growing tired.</p>

<p>One night, while the circus was in the town,
I mounted my horse just after dark and set off
for a ride. As I often rode for half the night,
I knew Campbell would think nothing of my
doing this. As soon as I was well away from
the house, I turned into the road that led to
the town, and put my horse&mdash;Little Chief&mdash;at
a rapid gallop. Within less than two hours, I
reached the town. Just before getting there, I
turned Little Chief loose, set his head toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the ranch, and bade him “scamper.” I had
taught him always to go to his stable as quickly
as possible when I said that word “scamper”
to him. This time I had removed the blanket
from his back and the bridle from his head.
I knew, therefore, he would be found in his
stall next morning with nothing on him to show
that he had been ridden.</p>

<p>As soon as Little Chief had started on his
scamper, I turned and walked into the town.
The circus performance was not quite over, so
I went to the door of the big tent and told the
man there that I wanted to see the proprietor
of the show on important business. I hadn’t
a cent of money, so I didn’t expect to go in.
But the man at the door politely invited me to
enter and see the end of the show. For a moment
I thought of accepting his invitation, but
then I remembered that all the ranch-men for
twenty miles round would be there, and that
they all knew me by sight as “that wild gal of
Campbell’s.” I didn’t want any of them to see
me at the circus, lest they should tell of it when
the search for me began. So I told the man
that I would not go in, and asked him where
and how I could see the owner of the show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
after the performance. He called a man and
told him to take me to “the Lady Superior, in
the dressing-tent.” I found out presently that
all the people in the circus called the manager’s
wife by that name, and the manager they called
“the Grand Panjandrum.” In fact, they had
a nickname of some sort for every one in
authority.</p>

<p>The Lady Superior received me as a queen
might. She had just been riding around the
ring in a red and gold chariot drawn by six
white horses, and playing Cleopatra in what
they called “the magnificent and gorgeous historical
panorama of human splendour.” As
Cleopatra, Napoleon, Alexander the Great,
George Washington, Genghis Khan, Julius
Cæsar, and a great many others took part in
the spectacle, the people in the audience must
have got their notions of history considerably
mixed up, but at any rate the Lady Superior
always seemed to enjoy her part, and particularly
her gorgeous raiment. I had a hard time
trying not to laugh in her face when I was first
presented to her on that night. She was still
dressed in her robe of flaming, high-coloured
silk, trimmed with ermine and spangles, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
her crown still on her head, and she was almost
greedily eating a dish of beef à la mode with
roast onions. But in spite of her gorgeous
apparel and her defective grammar, she proved
to be a good-natured creature, and she received
me very kindly.</p>

<p>I told her what I could do as a bareback rider,
and she took me to her hotel in her carriage as
soon as she had put on some plain clothes. I
told her that I didn’t want anybody in that
town to see me, so she drove up to a back door
of the little tavern and smuggled me into her
room. I remember that the tavern was a little
two-story, wooden building, with the inside partition
walls made of rough boards set on end so
loosely that one could see through the cracks
into the next room. But it was called the Transcontinental
Hotel, and the painter had found
some difficulty in getting the big name into one
line across the narrow front of the building.</p>

<p>In her room the Lady Superior gave me some
supper, she eating with me as heartily as if she
had not had a dish of beef à la mode with roast
onions less than half an hour before. She explained
to me that the circus people never take
their supper till after the performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>“It makes ’em lazy and not up to their work,”
she said.</p>

<p>When her husband, the Grand Panjandrum,
came in, she introduced me to him and told him
about my accomplishments.</p>

<p>He slapped his thigh with his palm and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That’s superb! We’ve just lost Mademoiselle
Fifine, our ‘matchless female equestrienne,’
and as we have advertised her everywhere, the
audiences are threatening to shoot me every
time I go into the ring as clown. You see,
audiences don’t like to be disappointed. I’ll
let you show me your paces in the morning,
and if you can do the stunts, I shall engage
you, and you shall appear as Mademoiselle Fifine
to-morrow afternoon and evening.”</p>

<p>I objected that I mustn’t be seen in that town,
lest I be recognised, whereupon he broke into
a laugh and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Recognised! Why, your own mother won’t
know you when the dresser gets you into
Mademoiselle Fifine’s finery, and daubs your
face with grease paint, and plasters it with powder.
Bridget’s clothes will just fit you.”</p>

<p>“Who is Bridget?” I asked, as I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
heard of that person before. The manager
laughed, and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bridget? Why, she was Mademoiselle Fifine,
you know. She wasn’t well up to the business,
but she was plucky and took risks, so she
got a very bad fall that broke her up, and she
had to quit and go to a hospital. She was a
good girl, and I am paying her expenses. If
she don’t die of her injuries, I’ll pay her board
somewhere as long as she lives. For she will
never ride again.”</p>

<p>Then a sudden thought occurred to the Grand
Panjandrum.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Sis,” he said. “Why can’t
we drive down to the tent, and you let me see
you ride a little to-night? You see, it will be a
sort of life insurance to me; for if we give the
show again without Fifine in it, some o’ them
wild Texans will shoot me, like as not. If you
can do the trick, I’ll get a printer to work, and
early in the morning we’ll come out with a
flaming announcement of ‘The Return of Mademoiselle
Fifine, the Matchless Equestrienne of
the Universe,’ and you can go into the ring at
the afternoon performance.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like the lies he intended to tell, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
I said so. I wanted him to give me some other
ring name, but he said that all his big, coloured
posters had Mademoiselle’s name on them, with
coloured pictures of her on horseback, and that
he couldn’t afford to throw the posters away,
even if there had been any printers in Texas
who could make new ones, as there were not.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, “you’ll be Mademoiselle
Fifine, just as much as Bridget was. Everybody
knows that the name is fictitious. All they want
is to see good riding, and if you can’t ride as
well as poor Bridget did, I couldn’t think of
engaging you.”</p>

<p>I had to consent, and indeed I saw that there
was really no deception to be practised. So the
Grand Panjandrum and the Lady Superior and I
sent for the carriage and drove back to the circus
tent, which was dark now, except for the dim
light of a few watchmen’s lanterns. I went to
the dressing-room and put on some of Fifine’s
riding-clothes&mdash;not those she wore in the presence
of the audience, but a plain practice gown
of black. Meanwhile the manager had made
the men light up a little and bring out some
horses.</p>

<p>I mounted and rode a little, doing my very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
best, though I was extremely nervous for fear
that I should not prove to be acceptable. I
suppose I rode a good deal better than Bridget
had done, for the manager, his wife, and all the
men in the ring seemed greatly delighted. I
ended by throwing some somersaults, and that
set them almost wild. The manager engaged
me on the spot, making me sign the contract in
the dressing-room tent before I had changed
my clothing. Then he hurried me back to the
tavern, registered me as Mademoiselle Fifine,
writing the name in a big hand all across the
page, and ordered me to bed.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be nervous at your first performance,”
he said; “so you must get plenty
of sleep.”</p>

<p>When it came time to go to the circus, I was
surprised to find that a special carriage, drawn
by two large, white horses with long, flowing
tails, had been provided for me. I learned
afterward that this was one of the Grand Panjandrum’s
devices for advertising his “matchless
equestrienne.” It gave the people the impression
that Mademoiselle Fifine was a person of
so much consequence that she must be treated
like a queen, and it led to many wild, exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
stories of the royal salary the manager
had to pay in order to secure so distinguished
an “artiste.” It was popularly believed that
“ten thousand a year wouldn’t touch her”;
that she had her own carriage and coachman
and footman and maid, and always the finest
rooms in the hotel. My salary, in fact, was fifty
dollars a month, and the “coachman” was one
of the ring attendants. But I did have the best
rooms in all the hotels. The Grand Panjandrum
insisted upon that, and he did it rather
noisily, too, complaining that the hotels really
had no rooms fit for such a person to live in.
All this was advertising, of course, but at any
rate I was made as comfortable as could be.</p>

<p>I succeeded very well indeed in the bareback
riding, and at my suggestion the manager sent
an agent to Campbell’s ranch and bought the
five or six horses there that I had trained. I
soon drilled them to perform little acts in the
ring which seemed to please the public. For
this the manager added ten dollars a month to
my salary. He and his wife were always very
good to me, but some of the actors in the circus
seemed jealous of the attention shown me and
of the applause I got. I was already miserable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
because I hated the business and especially my
own part of it.</p>

<p>The whole thing seemed to me vulgar, and
the people I had to associate with were very
coarse. But what could I do? Anything was
better than being Campbell’s daughter, and the
circus gave me a living at the least.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Fifteenth</p>

<p class="dci4">I DID not remain long with the circus&mdash;not
more than four or five months, I think&mdash;before
Campbell found out where I was and came
after me. If the manager had been a man of
any courage, I should have refused to go with
Campbell. But when Campbell threatened him
with all sorts of lawsuits and prosecutions, he
agreed to discharge me. Even then I should
not have gone with Campbell if I could have
got the money due me for my riding. But after
the first month the manager had paid me almost
nothing, on the plea of bad business (though his
tent was always packed), and as he was paying
all my expenses except for my plain clothes, I
hadn’t pressed him for the money. He owed
me nearly two hundred dollars when Campbell
came, and I asked him for it, meaning to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
away and find some other employment. But
Campbell told him he was my father and my
guardian, and that the money must be paid to
him and not to me. The manager weakly
yielded, and so I hadn’t enough money even to
pay a railroad fare.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, there was nothing
for me to do but go with Campbell. He had
sold the ranch, and was now keeping a big
wholesale store in the city of Austin. He had
built a very big house, and had a great many
negro servants in it. Soon after I got to Austin,
Campbell’s store was burned, and I thought at
first that he was ruined. But he seemed richer
after that than ever. My mother told me it was
the insurance money, and a good many people
used to think he had burned the store himself.
There was a lawsuit about it, but Campbell won.</p>

<p>One day I concluded to have a talk with him.
I asked him why he wanted to keep me with
him, and why he wouldn’t give me the money I
had earned in the circus, and let me go away.</p>

<p>He laughed at me, and told me it was because
he didn’t choose to have his daughter riding in
a circus. So I got no satisfaction out of him
then. But in the letter he sent me in the bundle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
of papers that Colonel Kilgariff brought me, he
explained the matter. It was because he feared
I would get somebody else to be my guardian,
and any new guardian would come upon him
for the stocks and bonds my father had given
me. Campbell had sold all of them that he could,
and was using the money himself.</p>

<p>After a while, Campbell became interested in
some kind of business&mdash;I don’t know what&mdash;out
in Arizona; and when he had to go out there
to stay for several months, he broke up his house
in Austin, and took my mother and me with him.
We lived in tents on the journey, and Campbell
grew very uneasy after a time, because there
were reports of a threatened Indian war. Still,
we travelled on, until at last we got among the
Indians themselves. They were very angry
about something, but Campbell seemed to know
how to deal with them, in some measure at
least. But presently the war broke out in earnest,
and Campbell told my mother he was completely
ruined, as he had put all his money into the
business, and this Indian war had destroyed it.</p>

<p>One day he had a parley with a big Indian
chief, and that night he took my mother and
went away somewhere, leaving me in the tent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
alone. About midnight a band of Indians came
to the tent, howling like so many demons. They
took me and carried me away on one of their
horses.</p>

<p>I was greatly frightened, but I pretended not
to be, and the Indians liked me for that. They
always like people who are not afraid. They
treated me well&mdash;or at any rate they did me no
harm&mdash;but they carried me away to their camp,
where all their squaws and children were; for
they were on the war-path now, and Indians
always take their families with them when they
go to war.</p>

<p>When I found that they were not disposed to
treat me badly I was almost glad they had captured
me; for at least they had taken me away
from Campbell, and I liked them much better
than I did him.</p>

<p>In the letter Campbell sent me by Colonel Kilgariff,
he told me that he had himself planned
my capture by the Indians. He had arranged it
with the chief when he had the parley with him;
and when he went away with my mother, leaving
me in the tent alone, he knew the Indians were
to catch me that night. He wanted them to get
me because then I couldn’t get another guardian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and he thought I could never come back
to trouble him about my money when I grew
up. I don’t know why he wrote all these
things to me, except that he was dying and
wanted me to know the whole story. He sent
me back all my papers, so that I might some
day get what was left of the property my father
had given me. Among other things, he told
me that my father was dead, and that he himself
had killed him in a fight.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Sixteenth</p>

<p class="dci4">I STAYED with the Indians for several
months&mdash;as long as the war lasted. It
was then that I lived on buffalo meat alone,
with no other food. Finally the soldiers conquered
the Indians and forced them to go back
on their reservation. Then Campbell came to
see if I was still alive, and, finding me, he took
me with him to New York, where he was practising
law and doing something in a bank.
That lasted a year or so. Nothing ever lasted
long with Campbell. But when he left New
York and went to Missouri to live, he seemed
to have plenty of money again.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, this war came on, and Campbell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
raised a company, got himself appointed its
captain, and went into the Confederate service.
After a while, he came home on a leave of
absence. He and my mother had been on very
bad terms for a long time, and things seemed
worse than ever.</p>

<p>One day, when he had been drinking a good
deal, he insulted my mother frightfully, and she
turned upon him at last, saying she intended to
expose his rascalities and “bring him to book”&mdash;that
was her phrase&mdash;for embezzling my
property.</p>

<p>Dorothy, I can’t tell you all about that scene.
I was so shocked and frightened that it gives
me a nightmare even now to recall it. Campbell
<i>killed my mother by choking her to death in
my presence</i>!</p>

<p>As I was the only person who saw him do it,
I think he would have killed me, too, if I had
not run from him. As it was, he followed me
presently, and with a pistol in his hand told me
I must go with him, adding that if I ever told
anybody what had happened he would kill me.</p>

<p>He took off his uniform and put on a suit of
citizen’s clothing. Then he made me mount
a horse, he mounting another, and we rode all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
night. In the morning we were in a Federal
camp.</p>

<p>I don’t know what Campbell told the Federal
officers, but he satisfied them somehow, and,
taking me with him, he went East. He put me
in charge of a very ugly old woman and her
daughter, somewhere up in the mountains of
Pennsylvania, not near any town or even village.
Then he went away, and for three years
I lived with those people, practically a prisoner.
They never for a moment let me out of their
sight, and at night I had to sleep in an upper
room, a kind of loft, which had no window and
no door&mdash;nothing but a trap-door over the
stairs. Every night the younger woman closed
the trap-door, fastening it below. The two
women slept in the room beneath.</p>

<p>If I could have got away, I should have gone,
even if I had been obliged to go into the woods
and starve. For the women treated me horribly,
and I could not forget the scene when my
mother was killed. I thought of her always as
she lay there on the floor, dead, with her face
purple and&mdash;I can’t write about that.</p>

<p>Once I tried to escape. By hard work I
made a hole in the roof above me, one night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and tried to climb up to it. But I missed my
hold and fell heavily to the floor. That brought
the two women up the stairs, and after that they
took away every stitch of my clothing every
night before I went to bed, not leaving me even
a nightgown. So I made no further efforts to
escape.</p>

<p>But I set to work in another way. I had
learned that Campbell was now an officer in the
Federal army, and I managed to find out how
to reach him with a letter, so I wrote to him.
I told him I intended to have him hanged for
killing my mother, and that it didn’t matter
how long he kept me in the mountains; that
some time or other, sooner or later, I should
get free; and that whenever that time came,
I meant to go to a lawyer and tell him all about
the crime.</p>

<p>I knew that this would make Campbell uneasy.
I thought it not improbable that he would
come up into the mountains and kill me, though
I thought he might be afraid to do that. You
see, when he killed my mother there was nobody
but me to tell about it, and he knew he could go
to the other side in the war and not be followed;
while if he should do anything to me up there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the Pennsylvania mountains, everybody would
know of it. For in that country everybody knew
when a stranger came into the neighbourhood,
and when he went away again. So I thought
Campbell would be afraid to kill me there. I
thought my letter would frighten him, and that
he would take me away from that place. That
was what I wanted. I thought that if I were
taken to any other place, I should have a better
chance of escaping.</p>

<p class="pc2">Chapter the Seventeenth</p>

<p class="dci5">THAT was not long before you saw me,
Dorothy, and it turned out as I had expected.
Campbell grew alarmed. He ordered
the two women to bring me to him in Washington.
When I got there, he told me that I had
relatives in Virginia who wanted me to come
to them, and that he had arranged to send me
through the lines under a flag of truce. I know
now that he was not telling me the truth, but I
believed him then, and I was ready to do anything
and go anywhere if only I could get out
of his clutches.</p>

<p>He took me into another room, where an
officer was writing, and there they made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
swear to a parole. Then Campbell took me
down to the Rapidan, and we went into that
house from which Colonel Kilgariff rescued me.
Campbell said that the flag of truce would start
from there, but that we must wait there for the
soldiers in charge of it to come.</p>

<p>When the shells struck the house and set it
on fire, Campbell took me to the cellar and left
me there, saying that he would be back in a few
minutes, and that there was no danger in the
cellar. I know now what his intention was.
He expected me to be burned to death there in
the cellar, and it would have happened that way,
but for Colonel Kilgariff.</p>

<p>There, Dorothy, dear: now you know all
about me that I know about myself.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XXIX</h2>

<p class="pch">EVELYN’S VIGIL</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">EVELYN BYRD’S exceeding truthfulness
of mind and soul made her a transparent
person for loving eyes to look through,
and Edmonia Bannister’s eyes were very loving
ones for her.</p>

<p>When she went to Branton for her ten days’
visit, Evelyn herself scarcely knew why she
wished thus to separate herself from Kilgariff;
but she went with a subconscious determination
to avoid all mention of his name. She could
hardly have adopted a surer means of revealing
her state of mind to so wise and so experienced a
woman as Edmonia.</p>

<p>After much thought upon the subject, Edmonia
sent a little note to Dorothy. In it she
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">You have never said a word to me on the subject,
Dorothy, but I am certain that you know what the
situation is between Evelyn and Kilgariff. So do I,
now, and I am not satisfied to have it so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless you peremptorily forbid, I am going to bring
on a crisis between those two. I am going to tell
Evelyn what Kilgariff has done for her in the matter
of this trust fund. When she knows that, there will
be a scene of some sort between them, and I think we
may trust love and human nature to bring it to a happy
conclusion.</p>

<p>If you will recall what occurred when the trust
papers were executed and given to us three, you will
remember that no promise of secrecy was exacted of
us. It is true we quite understood that we were to
say nothing to Evelyn about the matter until the
proper time should come; but we three are sole
judges as to what is the proper time, and Agatha and
I are both of the opinion that the proper time is now.
Unless you interpose your veto, therefore, I shall act
upon that opinion, making myself spokeswoman for
the trio.</p>

<p>Please send me a line in a hurry.</p></div>

<p class="p1">To this Dorothy replied by the messenger
who had brought the note. She wrote but a
single sentence, and that was a Biblical quotation.
She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day
of salvation.</p>

<p class="p1">On the evening before the day appointed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Evelyn’s return to Wyanoke, Dorothy received
a second note from Edmonia, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I don’t know whether we have done wisely or
otherwise. For once Evelyn is inscrutable. We
have told her of Kilgariff’s splendid generosity, and
we can’t make out how she takes it. She has grown
very silent and somewhat nervous. She is under a
severe emotional strain of some kind, but of what
kind we do not know. A storm of some sort is brewing,
and we must simply wait to learn what its character
is to be.</p>

<p>Evelyn is proud and exceedingly sensitive, as we
know. And there is a touch of the savage in her&mdash;or
rather the potentiality of the savage&mdash;and in a
case where she feels so strongly, it may result in an
outbreak of savage anger and resentment.</p>

<p>We needn’t worry, however, I think. Even such
an outbreak would in all probability turn out well.
Every storm passes, you know; and when the clouds
clear away, the skies are all the bluer for it. When a
man and a woman love each other and don’t know it,
or don’t let each other know it, any sort of crisis, any
sort of emotional collision, is apt to bring about a
favourable result.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Evelyn spent that evening in her room, writing
incessantly, far into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>She wrote a letter to Kilgariff. When she
read it over, she tore it up.</p>

<p>“It reads as if I were angry,” she said to herself,
“and anger is not exactly what I feel. I
wonder what I do feel.”</p>

<p>Then she wrote another letter to Kilgariff,
and put it aside, meaning to read it after a
while. In the meantime she wrote long and
lovingly to Dorothy, telling her she had decided
not to return to Wyanoke, but to go to Petersburg
instead, and help in nursing the soldiers.</p>

<p>When she had read that letter over, she was
wholly unsatisfied with it. Written words are
apt to mean so much more or so much less than
is intended. She put it aside and took up the
one to Kilgariff. As she read it, it seemed
even more unsatisfactory than the first.</p>

<p>“It is too humble in parts, and too proud in
parts,” she thought.</p>

<p>Again she set to work and wrote both letters
once more. The result was worse than before.
The letters seemed to ring with a false note,
and above all things she was determined to
meet this crisis in her life with absolute truth
and candour. Besides, she not only wanted to
utter her thought to Kilgariff&mdash;she wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
hear what he might have to say in reply, and
she wanted to see his face as he spoke, reading
there far more important things than any that
he could put into a letter.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realised that she was very cold.
The weather was growing severe now, and in
her preoccupation she had neglected her fire
until it had burned down to a mass of slowly
expiring coals.</p>

<p>Then she recovered her courage.</p>

<p>“I have been trying the cowardly way,” she
said aloud, but speaking only to herself. “I
must face these things bravely. I’ve been
planning to run away again, and I will not do
that. I’ve been running away all my life. I’ll
never run away again. I’ll go to Wyanoke in
the morning.”</p>

<p>With that, she gathered all the sheets on
which she had written and dropped them upon
the few coals which remained alive. The paper
smouldered and smoked for a time. Then it
broke into a flame and was quickly consumed.</p>

<p>The girl prepared herself for bed, with a degree
of composure which she had not been able
to command at any time since the knowledge of
Kilgariff’s act had come to her. When she blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
out her candle and opened the window, a gust
of snow was blown into her face, and she heard
the howling of the tempest without.</p>

<p>“It is the first storm of the winter,” she
thought, as she drew the draperies about her.
“How those poor fellows must be suffering
down there in the trenches at Petersburg to-night&mdash;half
clad, and less than half fed!”
Then, as she was sinking into sleep, she
thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m glad Mr. Kilgariff is not there to-night.”</p>

<p>The thought startled her into wakefulness
again, and during the remaining hours of the
night she lay sleeplessly thinking, thinking,
thinking.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XXX</h2>

<p class="pch">BEFORE A HICKORY FIRE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">EVELYN’S thinking accomplished its
purpose. At the end of it she understood
herself, or thought she did. And
when she returned to Wyanoke the next morning,
she thought she knew precisely what she
was going to say to Kilgariff. But who of us
ever knows what we will say in converse that
involves emotion? Who of us can know what
response his utterance will draw forth from the
other, or how far the original intent may be
turned into another by that response?</p>

<p>At any rate, Evelyn knew that she intended
to ask Colonel Kilgariff for an interview, and so
far she carried out her purpose.</p>

<p>They were left alone in the great drawing-room
at Wyanoke, where hickory logs were
merrily blazing in the cavernous fireplace, quite
as if there had been no war to desolate the land,
and no man and woman there with matters of
grave import to discuss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>Evelyn began the conference abruptly, as
soon as Kilgariff entered and took a seat.</p>

<p>“I have heard,” she began, “of what you
have done&mdash;of your great generosity toward
me. Of course I cannot permit that. You
must cancel those papers at once&mdash;to-day.
I cannot sleep while they exist.”</p>

<p>“Who told you of the matter?” Kilgariff
asked in reply.</p>

<p>“Edmonia, with Dorothy’s permission and
Mrs. Pegram’s.”</p>

<p>“They should not have told you. I meant
that you should not know till I am dead, unless&mdash;unless
I should live longer than I expect,
and you should fall into need when the war
ends.”</p>

<p>“But what right had you to treat me so? Do
you think me a beggar, that I should accept a
gift of money? Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>The girl was standing now and confronting
him, in manifest anger.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, he did not seem to mind
the anger. He had completely mastered himself,
and knew perfectly what he was to say.
He answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I did this because I love you, Evelyn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
because I cannot provide for your future in any
ordinary way.”</p>

<p>Seeing that she was about to make some
reply, he quickly forestalled it, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Please let me continue. Please do not
speak yet. Let me explain.”</p>

<p>The girl was still standing, but the look of
anger in her face had given way to another
expression&mdash;one more complex and less easily
interpreted. There was some pleasure in it,
and some apprehension, together with great
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said.</p>

<p>“Only on even terms,” he answered, rising
and standing in front of her. “What I have
to say to you must be said with my eyes looking
into yours. Now listen. By reason of a
quite absurd convention, a young woman may
not receive gifts of value, and especially of
money, from a young man not her husband;
yet she may freely take such gifts if they come
to her by his will, after he is dead.</p>

<p>“There are circumstances which render it impossible
for me to leave my possessions to you
by will. Any will that I might make to that
effect would be contested and broken by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
for whom I care so little that I would rather
sink everything I have in the world in the Atlantic
Ocean than let them inherit a dollar of it.</p>

<p>“There are also reasons which forbid me to
ask you to be my wife&mdash;at least until I shall
have laid those reasons before you.”</p>

<p>Evelyn was pale and trembling. Kilgariff
saw that it was difficult for her to stand, so,
taking her hand, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let us sit; I have a long story to tell.”
Whether purposely or not, he continued to
hold her hand after they were seated. Whether
consciously or not, she permitted him to do so,
without protest. He went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There was only one other way to accomplish
my purpose. It was and still is my wish that
everything I have in the world shall be yours
when I die. You are the woman I love, and
though I have no right to say so to you now,
my love for you is the one supreme passion of
my life&mdash;the first, the last, the only one. Pardon
me for saying that, and please forget it, at least
for the present. I have relatives, but they are
worse than dead to me, as you shall hear presently.
I would rather destroy everything I have
by fire or flood than allow one cent of it to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
into their unworthy hands. Enough of that.
Let me go on.</p>

<p>“There was only one way in which I could
carry out my purpose, and that was the one I
adopted. I could not consult you about it or
ask your permission, for that would have been
indeed to affront you in precisely the way in
which you now tell me I have affronted you. It
would have been to ask you to accept a money
gift at my hands while I yet lived. I intended,
instead, to give you all I possess, only after my
death and in effect by my will or its equivalent.
I did not intend you to be embarrassed by any
knowledge of my act, until a bullet or shell
should have laid me low. Now I want you to
speak, please. I want you to say that you understand,
and that you forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said; “there is nothing
to forgive; but now that I know your purpose,
I cannot permit it. You must cancel those
papers.”</p>

<p>“Does it make no difference that I have told
you I love you, and that I should entreat you to
be my wife if I were free to do so?”</p>

<p>“I do not see,” she replied, “that that makes
a difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not decide the matter now, wait!” he
half entreated, half commanded. “Let me finish
what I have to say. Let me tell you why I must
do this thing. Wait!”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, as if collecting his
thoughts. Then he told her his life-story, omitting
nothing, concealing nothing, palliating
nothing. That done, he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You understand now why I was driven to
the course I have adopted with you. You
understand that as an honourable man I could
not ask you for love, leaving you in ignorance
of the fact that I am under a conviction of felony.
My sentence is at an end, of course, and
I cannot be rearrested, inasmuch as I am officially
adjudged to be dead. But that makes no
difference in my duty. I could not honourably
reveal my love to you until you should know
the facts. I do not now ask you to accept my
wrecked life and to forget the facts that have
wrecked it. I have no right to ask so great a
sacrifice at your hands. I ask only that you
shall permit me to regard you as the woman I
love, the woman I should have sought to make
my wife if I had been worthy. I ask your permission
so to arrange my affairs, or so to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
them as already arranged, that at my death all
that I have will pass into your hands. You can
never know or dream or imagine how I love
you, Evelyn. Surely it is only a little thing
that I ask of you.”</p>

<p>As he delivered this passionate utterance,
Kilgariff threw his arm around the girl’s waist,
and for a moment held her closely. She let
her head rest upon his shoulder, and did not
resist or resent his impulse when he kissed her
reverently upon the forehead.</p>

<p>But an instant later, she suddenly realised
the situation, and quickly sprang to her feet,
he rising with her and facing her with strained
nerves and eyes fixed upon her own, sternly but
caressingly.</p>

<p>Evelyn Byrd was not given to tears, and for
that reason the drops that now trickled down
her cheeks had far more meaning to Kilgariff
than a woman’s tears sometimes have for a man.</p>

<p>For a time, she looked him full in the face,
not attempting to conceal her tears even by
brushing them away. She simply let them
flow, as an honest expression of her emotion.</p>

<p>Finally she so far composed herself as to
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>“Owen Kilgariff,” she said&mdash;it was the first
time she had ever so addressed him&mdash;“Owen
Kilgariff, you have dealt honestly with me; I
want to deal honestly with you. If I were
worthy of your love, I should rejoice in it. As
it is, this is the greatest calamity of my life.
You do not know&mdash;but you shall. There are
reasons that forbid me to accept the love you
have offered&mdash;peremptory reasons. You shall
know them quickly.”</p>

<p>With that she glided out of the room, and
Owen Kilgariff was left alone.</p>

<p class="pch">THE LAST FLIGHT OF EVELYN</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">EVELYN went for a few minutes to her
room. There she bathed her eyes; for
like all women, she was ashamed of the
tears that did her honour by attesting the tender
intensity of her womanhood.</p>

<p>That done, she went to the laboratory, where
she found Dorothy at work. To her she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Please let me have my book. I want Mr.
Kilgariff to read it.”</p>

<p>Dorothy asked no explanation. She needed
none. She went at once and fetched the manuscript.
Evelyn took it and returned to the parlour,
where she placed it in Kilgariff’s hands.</p>

<p>“Please read that, carefully,” she said. “Then
you will understand.”</p>

<p>“If you mean,” he replied, “that anything
this manuscript may reveal concerning your
past life can lessen my love for you, you are
utterly wrong, and the reading is unnecessary.
If you wish only that I shall know you better,
and more perfectly understand the influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
that have made you the woman you are, I shall
be glad to read every line and word that you
have written.”</p>

<p>“Please read it.” That was all she said, and
she instantly left the room.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she told Dorothy she
wanted the carriage.</p>

<p>“I want to go to Warlock,” she said, “on a
little visit to Mrs. Pegram. Oh, Dorothy! you
understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” answered Dorothy, “I understand.
It is rather late to start to Warlock.
It is a thirty-mile drive. But I’ll give you
Dick for your coachman, and there is a moon.
Dick is quite a military man now, and he knows
what a forced march means. He’ll get you to
Warlock in time for a late supper.”</p>

<p>Dick drove like a son of Jehu. After the
manner of the family negro in Virginia, he
shrewdly conjectured what was in the wind;
and when he put up his horses at Warlock
before even the regular supper was served, he
said to the stableman:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I reckon mebbe Mas’ Owen Kilgariff’ll want
stablin’ here for a good horse to-morrow, an’
purty soon in de mawnin’ at dat.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="ch">XXXII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE END OF IT ALL</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">DICK was right. Kilgariff read nearly
all night, and finished Evelyn’s book
in the small hours of the morning.
Then he slept more calmly than he had done at
any time during recent weeks.</p>

<p>At six o’clock he went to the kitchen
and negotiated with Aunt Kizzey, the cook,
for an immediate cup of coffee. Then he
mounted the war-horse that had brought him
to Wyanoke&mdash;sleek and strong, now, and full
of gallop&mdash;and set off for Warlock plantation.</p>

<p>When he got there, the nine o’clock breakfast
was just ready, but he had luckily met
Evelyn in a strip of woodland, where she was
walking in spite of the snow that lay ankle-deep
upon the ground. Dismounting, he said
to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have read your book from beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
end, Evelyn. I have come now for your answer
to my question.”</p>

<p>“What question?” she asked, less frankly
than was her custom.</p>

<p>“Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;gladly,” she said, “if my story makes
no difference.”</p>

<p>“It makes a great difference,” he responded.
“It tells me, as nothing else could, what a
woman you are. It intensifies my love, and
my resolution to make all the rest of your life
an atonement to you for the suffering you have
endured.”</p>

<p>The next day Evelyn cut short her visit to
Warlock and returned to Wyanoke. At the
same time Kilgariff went back to Petersburg to
bear his part in the closing scenes of the greatest
war of all time.</p>

<p>Grant was already in possession of the Weldon
Railroad. With his limitless numbers, he
had been able to stretch his line southward
and westward until his advance threatened the
cutting off of the two other railroads that
constituted Richmond’s only remaining lines of
communication southward. Lee’s small force,
without hope of reinforcement, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
stretched out into a line so long and so thin
that at many points the men holding the works
stood fully a dozen yards apart.</p>

<p>Still, they held on with a grim determination
that no circumstance could conquer.</p>

<p>They perfectly knew that the end was approaching.
They perfectly knew that that end
could mean nothing to them but disaster.
Nevertheless, they stood to their guns and
stubbornly resisted every force hurled against
them. With heroic cheerfulness, they fought
on, never asking themselves to what purpose.
Throughout the winter they suffered starvation
and cold; for food was scarce, and of clothing
there was none.</p>

<p>Surely the spectacle was one in contemplation
of which the angels might have paused in admiration.
Surely the heroism of those devoted
men was an exhibition of all that is best in the
American character, a display of courage which
should be for ever cherished in the memory of
all American men.</p>

<p>When the spring came, and the roads hardened,
Grant delivered the final blow. Sherman
had cut the Confederacy in two by his march to
the sea, and was now, in overwhelming force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
pushing his way northward again, with intent
to unite his army with Grant’s for Lee’s destruction.</p>

<p>Then Grant concentrated a great army on his
left and struck a crushing blow. Lee withdrew
from Richmond and Petersburg, and made a
desperate endeavour to retreat to some new line
of defence farther south.</p>

<p>The effort was foredoomed to failure. It
ended in the surrender at Appomattox of a
little fragment of that heroic Army of Northern
Virginia which had for so long stood its
ground against overwhelming odds, and so manfully
endured hunger and cold and every other
form of suffering that may befall the soldier.</p>

<p>It was during that last retreat that Kilgariff
and Evelyn met for the first time since they had
plighted troth, and for the last time as mere
man and woman, not husband and wife.</p>

<p>Kilgariff, a brigadier-general now, had been
ordered to take command of the guns defending
the rear. By night and by day he was always
in action. But when the line of march passed
near to Wyanoke, he sent a messenger to
Evelyn, bearing a note scrawled upon a scrap
of paper which he held against his saddle-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
in lieu of a desk. In the note he wrote
simply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Come to me, wherever I am to be found. I want
you to be my wife before I die. You have courage.
Come to me&mdash;we’ll be married in battle, and the
guns shall play the wedding march.</p>

<p class="p1">Evelyn responded to the summons, and these
two were made one upon the battlefield, with
bullets flying about their heads and rifle shells
applauding.</p>

<p>The ceremony ended, Evelyn rode away to
Wyanoke to await the end. A week later Owen
Kilgariff joined her there.</p>

<p>“We are beginning life anew,” he said, “and
together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “and at last I have
nothing to fear.”</p>

it in such terms as “Breathless interest,” “The high
water mark of American fiction since Uncle Tom’s

and delicate,” “As good a story of adventure as
one can find,” “The best style of love story, clean,

<p>Mingles the romance of the forest with the romance of
man’s heart, making a story that is big and elemental, while
not lacking in sweetness and tenderness. It is an epic of the

permeated by out of door freshness, and the glory of the
struggle with nature.</p>

<p class="pn">THE SILENT PLACES</p>

<p>A powerful story of strenuous endeavor and fateful privation
in the frozen North, embodying also a detective story of
much strength and skill. The author brings out with sure
touch and deep understanding the mystery and poetry of the
still, frost-bound forest.</p>

<p class="pn">THE CLAIM JUMPERS</p>

<p>A tale of a Western mining camp and the making of a man,

<p class="pn">THE CALL OF THE WILD:</p>

<p class="pn">With illustrations by Philip R. Goodwin and Charles Livingston
Bull. Decorated by Charles Edward Hooper.</p>

<p>“A big story in sober English, and with thorough art in the
construction ... a wonderfully perfect bit of work. The dog
adventures are as exciting as any man’s exploits could be, and
Mr. London’s workmanship is wholly satisfying.”&mdash;<i>The New

<p class="pn">THE SEA WOLF: Illustrated by W. J. Aylward.</p>

<p>“This story surely has the pure Stevenson ring, the adventurous

and the clay, the ease-loving, well-to-do, half-drowned man,
to all appearances his helpless prey.”&mdash;<i>Critic.</i></p>

<p class="pn">THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS:</p>

<p>A vivid and intensely interesting picture of life, as the author
found it, in the slums of London. Not a survey of impressions
formed on a slumming tour, but a most graphic account
of real life from one who succeeded in getting on the
“inside.” More absorbing than a novel. A great and vital
book. Profusely illustrated from photographs.</p>

<p class="pn">THE SON OF THE WOLF:</p>

<p>“Even the most listless reader will be stirred by the virile
force, the strong, sweeping strokes with which the pictures of
the northern wilds and the life therein are painted, and the in-sight
given into the soul of the primitive of nature.”&mdash;<i>Plain
Dealer, Cleveland.</i></p>

<p class="pn">A DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS:</p>

<p>It is a book about a woman, whose personality and plan in

story has the rapid movement, incident and romantic flavor
which have interested so many in his tales. The illustrations

its evident realism and truth to life and conditions have
gained for it the title of “The ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of

Professor of Horticulture, Cornell University.
Suggestions for the Utilizing of Home
Grounds. 12 mo., cloth, 250 illustrations.</p>

<p class="reduct">Here is a book literally “for the million” who in broad
America have some love for growing things. It is useful alike
to the owner of a suburban garden plot and to the owner of a
“little place” in the country. Written by the Professor of
Horticulture at Cornell University it tells of ornamental gardening
of any range, treats of fruits and vegetables for home
use, and cannot fail to instruct, inspire and educate the reader.</p>

<p class="pi1">THE PRACTICAL GARDEN BOOK, by <span class="smcap">C. E.
Hunn and L. H. Bailey</span>.</p>

<p class="reduct">Containing the simplest directions for growing the commonest
things about the house and garden. Profusely illustrated.
12 mo., cloth. Just the book for the busy man or woman who
wants the most direct practical information as to just how to
plant, prune, train and to care for all the common fruits, flowers,
vegetables, or ornamental bushes and trees. Arranged alphabetically,
like a miniature encyclopedia, it has articles on the
making of lawns, borders, hot-beds, window gardening, lists of
plants for particular purposes, etc.</p>

<p class="pi1">A WOMAN’S HARDY GARDEN, by <span class="smcap">Helena
Rutherfurd Ely</span>. With forty-nine illustrations
from photographs taken in the author’s
garden by Prof. C. F. Chandler. 12 mo., cloth.</p>

<p class="reduct">A superbly illustrated volume, appealing especially to the
many men and women whose love of flowers and all things
green is a passion so strong that it often seems to be a sort of
primal instinct, coming down through generation after generation
from the first man who was put into, a garden “to dress it
and keep it.” The instructions as to planting, maintenance,
etc., are clear and comprehensive, and can be read and practiced
with profit by both amateur and professional.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
